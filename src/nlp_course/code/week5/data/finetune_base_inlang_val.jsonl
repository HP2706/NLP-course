A transition state is typically marked in the chemical literature by placing it in square brackets and marking it with a double cross \u2021. The transition state is unstable and very short-lived. It usually takes about 10 seconds.

According to the molecular orbital theory, the bond order is the difference between the electrons located in the bonding orbitals and the orbitals located in the dissociating orbitals divided by two. Most often, the bond order number is a whole number, but it can also be a fractional number. This is typical for compounds whose structures have several resonance modes, for example the bond order of benzene is 1.5. The bond order number can be used as a qualitative measure of bond strength.

In compounds, magnetic atomic nuclei oscillate in an external magnetic field at a resonance frequency characteristic of each atomic nucleus. Also, the resonance frequencies of nuclei that are similar but in different chemical environments differ slightly from each other. These frequencies are compared to a reference standard and the difference is called the chemical shift.
