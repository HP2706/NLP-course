The term \u1f00\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2 (') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ' as \"atheistic\". As an abstract noun, there was also ('), \"atheism\". Cicero transliterated the Greek word into the Latin \"\".

It is an innovative advance that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV transmits in a new image format called HDTV (high definition television), with greater resolution than analog TV, in a wide screen aspect ratio similar to recent movies in contrast to the narrower screen of analog TV. It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit multiple channels, up to 7, in the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television, and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 tulee nimitys digitelevisio?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\ntransmission of television signals, including the sound channel, using digital encoding"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The \"Witte Brigade\" (White Brigade) of the Belgian resistance had captured the Port of Antwerp, before the Germans could destroy the port. Antwerp was a deep water inland port connected to the North Sea via the river Scheldt.

On returning to Japan in 1879, Isawa formed the Ongaku-Torishirabe-Gakari (Music Investigation Agency), a national research center for Western music; it was later renamed the Tokyo Music School (T\u00f4ky\u00f4 ongaku gakk\u00f4). In 1880, Isawa's American friend and teacher, Luther Whiting Mason, took up a two-year appointment to further develop the music curriculum of Japanese schools.

Discounting the special circumstances of the temporary closure of Kise stable from 2010 until 2012, there were no new stables established for more than six years, while eleven folded, bringing the number of active stables down to 43. This sequence was ended by the opening of former \"yokozuna\" Musashimaru's Musashigawa stable in April 2013.

In embryonic life, the SVZ refers to a secondary proliferative zone containing neural progenitor cells, which divide to produce neurons in the process of neurogenesis. The primary neural stem cells of the brain and spinal cord, termed radial glial cells, reside in the ventricular zone (VZ) (so-called because the VZ lines the developing ventricles). In the developing cerebral cortex, which resides in the dorsal telencephalon, the SVZ and VZ are transient tissues that do not exist in the adult.

Application of the term \"Indian\" originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for India, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. Eventually, those islands came to be known as the \"West Indies\", a name still used. This led to the blanket term \"Indies\" and \"Indians\" (Spanish , Portuguese ) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced, or tolerated, by many over the last two centuries. Even though the term \"Indian\" generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas\u2014such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years before, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East\u2014these groups are nonetheless considered \"indigenous peoples of the Americas\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3\u306f\u5dee\u5225\u7528\u8a9e\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 north latitude, and from 10\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edge\u00f8ya. Administratively, the archipelago is not part of any Norwegian county, but forms an unincorporated area administered by a governor appointed by the Norwegian government. Since 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, Longyearbyen, has had an elected local government, somewhat similar to mainland municipalities. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research station of Ny-\u00c5lesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. Ny-\u00c5lesund is the northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population.

They normally offer a wide variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some cases, the food is presented as a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord, sometimes self service. The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount. Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world. A form of fast food created in Japan (where bent\u014d is the Japanese variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried laver) with filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber. Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with nationwide chains including Papa John's, Domino's Pizza, Sbarro and Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children's fast food calories. Menus are more limited and standardized than in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u306f\u5bff\u53f8\u3092\u542b\u307f\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

With Waldeck Rochet as its new secretary-general, the party supported Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's unsuccessful presidential bid in 1965. During the student riots and strikes of May 1968, the party supported the strikes while denouncing the revolutionary student movements. After heavy losses in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the party adopted Georges Marchais as leader and in 1973 entered into a \"Common Programme\" alliance with Mitterrand's reconstituted Socialist Party (PS). Under the Common Programme, however, the PCF steadily lost ground to the PS, a process that continued after Mitterrand's victory in 1981. Initially allotted a minor share in Mitterrand's government, the PCF resigned in 1984 as the government turned towards fiscal orthodoxy. Under Marchais the party largely maintained its traditional communist doctrines and structure. Extensive reform was undertaken after 1994, when Robert Hue became leader. This did little to stem the party's declining popularity, although it entered government again in 1997 as part of the Plural Left coalition. Elections in 2002 gave worse results than ever for the PCF. Under Marie-George Buffet, the PCF turned away from parliamentary strategy and sought broader social alliances. To maintain a presence in parliament after 2007 the party's few remaining deputies had to join others in the Democratic and Republican Left group (GDR). Subsequently a broader electoral coalition, the Left Front (FG), was formed including the PCF, the Left Party (PG), United Left, and others. The FG has brought the French communists somewhat better electoral results. Pierre Laurent was leader from 2010 to 2018.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u5171\u7523\u515a\u306f\u89e3\u4f53\u3057\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In the 19th century, \"language\" was considered a property of \"ethnicity\", and thus the speakers of the Indo-Iranian or Indo-European languages came to be called the \"Aryan race\", as contradistinguished from what came to be called the \"Semitic race\". By the late 19th century, among some people, the notions of an \"Aryan race\" became closely linked to Nordicism, which posited Northern European racial superiority over all other peoples. This \"master race\" ideal engendered both the \"Aryanization\" programs of Nazi Germany, in which the classification of people as \"Aryan\" and \"non-Aryan\" was most emphatically directed towards the exclusion of Jews. By the end of World War II, the word 'Aryan' had become associated by many with the racial ideologies and atrocities committed by the Nazis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u4eba\u4eba\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nIndo-Iranian or Indo-European"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The majority of works from this period are chronicles and hagiographies. Bohemian hagiographies focus exclusively on Bohemian saints (Sts. Ludmila, Wenceslas, Procopius, Cyril and Methodius, and Adalbert), although numerous legends about Bohemian saints were also written by foreign authors. The most important chronicle of the period is the Chronica Boemorum (Bohemian Chronicle) by Cosmas, though it does approach its topics with then-contemporary politics in mind, and attempts to legitimize the ruling dynasty. Cosmas' work was updated and extended by several authors in the latter part of the 12th and during the 13th centuries. During the first part of the 13th century, the P\u0159emyslid rulers of Bohemia expanded their political and economic influence westward and came into contact with the political and cultural kingdoms of Western Europe. This cultural exchange was evident in literature through the introduction of German courtly poetry, or Minnesang, in the latter part of the 13th century. After the murder of Wenceslas III and the subsequent upheavals in the kingdom in 1306, however, the Bohemian nobles distanced themselves from German culture and looked for literature in their native language. Despite this, German remained an important literary language in Bohemia until the 19th century. This new literature in Czech consisted largely of epic poetry of two types: the legend and the knightly epic, both based on apocryphal tales from the Bible, as well as hagiographic legends of earlier periods. Prose was also first developed during this period: administrative and instructional texts, which necessitated the development of a more extensive and specialized vocabulary; the first Czech-Latin dictionaries date from this time. Extensive chronicles, of which the \"Chronicle of Dalimil\" and \"Chronicon Aulae Regiae\" (the \"Zbraslav Chronicle\") are the most striking examples, and artistic prose (e.g. Smil Fla\u0161ka z Pardubic and Johannes von Saaz) were also written.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0435\u043c \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0427\u0435\u0448\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u00bb?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nCosmas"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The perpetrators were targeting the victims based solely on the ethnicity factor- being Armenian was the only criterion.  Some sources speak of premeditation ahead of the break-out of violence.  Cobbles were brought into the city to block and limit access and exit from the town; the perpetrators had previously obtained the list of addresses of the Armenian residents of the city. Warnings by Azerbaijanis sympathetic to their Armenian neighbors instructed them to leave their lights on the night of the 27th; those who shut them off would be assumed to be Armenian. According to several Armenian witnesses and Soviet military personnel, alcohol and \"anasha\", a term referring to narcotics, were brought in trucks and distributed to the crowds, although such accounts were not reported in the media. According to de Waal, notes that the attackers were armed with homemade weapons that would have taken some time and effort to manufacture, suggested a certain level of planning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0421\u0443\u043c\u0433\u0430\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nethnicity"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. \"L\u00fctzow\" was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58 million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. \"Hindenburg\", the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59 million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430 \u00ab\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0444\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440\u00bb?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nBlohm & Voss"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4\u20135 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50\u2013150 cells. Isolating the embryoblast, or inner cell mass (ICM) results in destruction of the blastocyst, a process which raises ethical issues, including whether or not embryos at the pre-implantation stage should have the same moral considerations as embryos in the post-implantation stage of development. Researchers are currently focusing heavily on the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells, with clinical use being the goal for many labs. Potential uses include the treatment of diabetes and heart disease. The cells are being studied to be used as clinical therapies, models of genetic disorders, and cellular\/DNA repair.

There is as yet no direct evidence for bows during the African Pleistocene, and the hypothesis that very early, stone points were used to tip darts or arrows remains unsupported by use-trace studies and contextual evidence.

In humans, most mammals, and some other species, two of the chromosomes, called the X chromosome and Y chromosome, code for sex. In these species, one or more genes are present on their Y chromosome that determine maleness. In this process, an X chromosome and a Y chromosome act to determine the sex of offspring, often due to genes located on the Y chromosome that code for maleness.

He was the only Israeli soldier killed during the raid (along with three hostages, all of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine members, and dozens of Ugandan soldiers). The commonly accepted version of his death is that Netanyahu fired on Ugandan soldiers, and was shot in response by an African from the airport's control tower. The family refused to accept this verdict, and insisted instead that he was killed by the German commanding the hijackers. Netanyahu was shot outside the building being stormed, and would soon die in the arms of Efraim Sneh, commander of the mission's medical unit.

In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in Union Square, and by the end of the century, many theatres were near Madison Square. Theatres did not arrive in the Times Square area until the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres did not consolidate there until a large number of theatres were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's \"musical burletta\" \"The Seven Sisters\" (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances. It was at a performance by Keene's troupe of \"Our American Cousin\" in Washington, D.C. that Abraham Lincoln was shot. The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be \"The Black Crook\", which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, \"The Black Domino\/Between You, Me and the Post\" was the first show to call itself a \"musical comedy\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306f\u3044\u3064\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1857"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In 1417, Wallachia accepted the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire; this lasted until the 19th century, albeit with brief periods of Russian occupation between 1768 and 1854. In 1859, Wallachia united with Moldavia to form the United Principalities, which adopted the name \"Romania\" in 1866 and officially became the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. Later, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the resolution of the elected representatives of Romanians in 1918, Bukovina, Transylvania as well as parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 were allocated to the Kingdom of Romania, thereby forming the modern Romanian state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30ef\u30e9\u30ad\u30a2\u516c\u56fd\u306f\u4f55\u5e74\u307e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1859"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

To prepare construction, a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological properties similar to London. This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train, and was later, in 1861, filled up. The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground \"inner circle\" connecting London's main-line stations. The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884, built using the cut and cover method. Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow, Uxbridge, Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u3067\u6700\u521d\u306b\u8a2d\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u5730\u4e0b\u9244\u99c5\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nMetropolitan District Railway"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK 2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK 317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK 142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK 494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins.

During magma crystallization, caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium, the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite (KCl) and carnallite () may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals. Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl () and avogadrite (), up to 15 wt% CsO in the closely related mineral pezzottaite (Cs(BeLi)AlSiO), up to 8.4 wt% CsO in the rare mineral londonite (), and less in the more widespread rhodizite. The only economically important ore for caesium is pollucite , which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites, associated with the more commercially important lithium minerals, lepidolite and petalite. Within the pegmatites, the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals results in high-grade ore for mining.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30bb\u30b7\u30a6\u30e0\u306f\u5730\u6bbb\u3067\u4f55\u756a\u76ee\u306b\u591a\u304f\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nberyl () and avogadrite"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Fields are free from PCN until an introduction occurs, after which the typical patches, or hotspots, occur on the farmland. These patches can become full field infestations when unchecked.

Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of the India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Many scholars believe that Hindu spirituality formed the essential part of his political and social thought throughout his adult life, although there was no sense of bigotry or orthodoxy in it. Subhas who called himself a socialist, believed that socialism in India owed its origins to Swami Vivekananda. As historian Leonard Gordon explains \"Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life.

In 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was sold to Circle Communications, where it retained its own identity as a division within the company. The following year, Circle Communications was taken over by Southern Star Entertainment UK. Under the new ownership, Oxford Scientific Films continued to enhance its reputation for innovative film-making, producing multiple award-winning series and films, including the highly acclaimed Animal Planet series, \"Meerkat Manor\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30aa\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u79d1\u5b66\u52d5\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u306f\u3044\u3064\u8a2d\u7acb\u3057\u305f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n8 July 1968"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

It started with the end of the Han dynasty and was followed by the Jin dynasty. The term \"Three Kingdoms\" is something of a misnomer, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed suzerainty over all China. Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among English-speaking sinologists. To distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of the same names, historians have added a relevant character to the state's original name: the state that called itself \"Wei\" () is also known as \"Cao Wei\" (), the state that called itself \"Han\" () is also known as \"Shu Han\" () or just \"Shu\" (), and the state that called itself \"Wu\" () is also known as \"Eastern Wu\" () or \"Sun Wu\" ().<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u4e09\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u540d\u79f0\u306e\u7531\u6765\u306f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\ntripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as \"the real 6th Dalai Lama\" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama. He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30b1\u30eb\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30c4\u30a9\u306f\u4f55\u6b73\u3067\u30c0\u30e9\u30a4\u30fb\u30e9\u30de\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n12"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Fisher, the ship was very lightly armoured and designed to be armed with only two heavy guns (18-inch), one forward and one aft, plus a number of lesser guns. \"Furious\" was modified and became an aircraft carrier while under construction. Her forward turret was removed and a flight deck was added in its place, such that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land. Later in the war, the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure, but this was less than satisfactory due to air turbulence. \"Furious\" was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck in the early 1920s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u822a\u7a7a\u6bcd\u8266\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u8239\u9577\u306f\u8ab0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nLord Fisher"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general\u2014and in particular, the uncomputability of the Entscheidungsproblem (\"decision problem\").<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u540d\u79f0\u306e\u7531\u6765\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nAlan Turing"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive.

However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers. The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8d77\u6e90\u306f\u3044\u3064<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1872"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

At the same time she studied Technology and Policy at the Technical University of Eindhoven. She combined the PKRA World Tour season in 2006 with finishing her Masters degree. After her studies she wanted to combine her professional kite surfing career with a job outside of sports. She took a job offer from KPN, a Dutch telecommunication company and she focused on a new discipline in kite surfing, speed kiting as it is easier to train for in the Netherlands and because it has less competitions during a year. In L\u00fcderitz, Namibia she set a new Dutch women outright speed record, meaning that she is the fastest Dutch women powered by wind on the water.

In 1737, an Uji-based tea grower named Nagatani S\u014den developed what is now the standard process for making leaf teas in Japan: tea leaves are first steamed, then rolled into narrow needles and dried in an oven. The process imparts a vivid emerald color to the leaf, along with a \"clean\", sometimes sweet flavor. Nagatani's tea caught the attention of his friend Baisao, becoming synonymous with the \"sencha\" method of steeping tea. It thereafter came to be known by the same name. \"Sencha\" grew in popularity over time, and is now the most popular form of tea in Japan, representing 80 percent of all tea produced each year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u714e\u8336\u304c\u683d\u57f9\u3055\u308c\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1737"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Industrial railways were used to transport ore or other industrial products to ports, although they have, particularly to begin with, also operated passenger and cargo services. The other nine private railways have been public and operated as mixed passenger and freight services. Of these, four were later taken over by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). Only five non-industrial railways were never nationalized, although all have been closed. There were the Nesttun\u2013Os, Holmestrand\u2013Vittingfoss, Lillesand\u2013Flaksvand, T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Eidsfoss and the Lier lines.

Considered the \"father of the computer\", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u660e\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f\u8ab0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nCharles Babbage"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

They presented Shakespeare plays and ballad operas such as \"The Beggar's Opera\". In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and opened with \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"The Anatomist\". The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like \"Damon and Phillida\". The Revolutionary War suspended theatre in New York, but thereafter theatre resumed in 1798, the year the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street (now called Park Row).

Wells in 1932. \"Futurology\" is a term common in encyclopedias, though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today, at least in the English-speaking world. \"Futurology\" is defined as the \"study of the future.\" The term was coined by German professor Ossip K. Flechtheim in the mid-1940s, who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of probability. This term may have fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u672a\u6765\u5b66\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5206\u91ce\u306f\u3044\u3064\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nmid-1940s"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by Bogdan I (1359\u20131365), a nobleman from Maramure\u015f, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and vassalage to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, Mircea the Old of Wallachia (1386\u20131418) and Stephen the Great of Moldavia (1457\u20131504) conducted successful military operations against the Ottoman Turks. The two principalities' trade with other parts of Europe began to decrease after the last decades of the 15th century. Before this the sale of hides, grain, honey, and wax to the Holy Roman Empire, Venice and Poland, and the import of silk, weapons and other manufactured goods from these areas had been widespread, but by the end of the 16th century the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30ef\u30e9\u30ad\u30a2\u306e\u4e3b\u8981\u7523\u696d\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nhides, grain, honey, and wax"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

An example is the extensive work by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre at Vaux-le-Vicomte for King Louis XIV of France at the Palace of Versailles. The first person to write of \"making\" a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828, and John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the \"Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u8005\u306f\u8ab0\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nGilbert Laing Meason"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

This belief dates back to the first centuries of Christianity. Such acts are considered intrinsically disordered because of the belief that all licit sexual acts must be both unitive (express love), and procreative (open to procreation). The only form of birth control permitted is abstinence. Modern scientific methods of \"periodic abstinence\" such as natural family planning (NFP) were counted as a form of abstinence by Pope Paul VI in his 1968 encyclical \"Humanae Vitae\".

His first Formula One drive was with the Theodore team during the 1978 season. He immediately caught the attention of the Formula One paddock with a superb drive in the non-Championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone in just his second race with the team, emerging victorious after many of the big names had been caught out by a tremendous downpour. Rosberg was not able to qualify for a race afterwards, and was signed by another uncompetitive team, ATS, for three races after the Theodore team scrapped its unreliable car design. He returned to Theodore after they acquired chassis from the Wolf Formula One team, but these were also uncompetitive and Rosberg returned to ATS to end the season.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30b1\u30a4\u30e8\u30fb\u30a8\u30ea\u30af\u30fb\"\u30b1\u30b1\"\u30fb\u30ed\u30ba\u30d9\u30eb\u30b0\u306e\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u6226\u306f\u4f55<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1978"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of attention and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u9000\u5c48\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u95a2\u4fc2\u306b\u3082\u9069\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Takahashi chose to coin a new word rather than use the existing translation of the English term \"masquerade\" because that translates into Japanese as \"an aristocratic costume\", which did not match his experience of the WorldCon. The coinage reflects a common Japanese method of abbreviation in which the first two moras of a pair of words are used to form an independent compound: 'costume' becomes \"kosu\" (\u30b3\u30b9) and 'play' becomes \"pure\" (\u30d7\u30ec).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u6587\u5316\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u767a\u7965\u306e\u30b5\u30d6\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nThe term \"cosplay\" is a Japanese portmanteau of the English terms costume and play"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. Criteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), while 21 national parks are designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR). Eight national parks are designated in both UNESCO programs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u5408\u8846\u56fd\u306b\u306f\u56fd\u7acb\u516c\u5712\u304c\u3044\u304f\u3064\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n60"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. His 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology. On 14 November 1750, Euler wrote to a friend that he had realised the importance of the \"edges\" of a polyhedron. This led to his polyhedron formula, \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" + \"F\" = 2 (where \"V\", \"E\" and \"F\" respectively indicate the number of vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron).

The original meaning of \"piracy\" is \"robbery or illegal violence at sea\", but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement. \"Theft\", meanwhile, emphasizes the potential commercial harm of infringement to copyright holders. However, copyright is a type of intellectual property, an area of law distinct from that which covers robbery or theft, offenses related only to tangible property. Not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not \"easily\" equate with theft.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u306e\u4fb5\u5bb3\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066\u6cd5\u5ef7\u3067\u4e89\u308f\u308c\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1985"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Alfred styled himself \"King of the Anglo-Saxons\" from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex. The last monarch of a distinct kingdom of England was Anne, who became Queen of Great Britain when England merged with Scotland to form a union in 1707.  Arguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the Heptarchy to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa, king of Mercia, and Egbert, king of Wessex, are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions are part of a process leading to a unified England, as highlighted by historian Simon Keynes stating, for example, that \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" This refers to a period in the late 8th century when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but this did not survive his death in 796. In 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. It was not until the late 9th century that one kingdom, Wessex, had become the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title \"King of the Angles and Saxons\", but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then known as the Danelaw, having earlier been conquered by the Danes from Scandinavia. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son \u00c6thelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first true king of England. The title \"King of the English\" or \"Rex Anglorum\" in Latin, was first used to describe \u00c6thelstan in one of his charters in 928.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u521d\u4ee3\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u738b\u306f\u8ab0\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nAlfred the Great"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Trains without \"an automatic cab signal, automatic train stop or automatic train control system \"may not exceed 79 mph.\" The order was issued in 1947 (effective 31 Dec 1951) by the Interstate Commerce Commission following a severe 1946 crash in Naperville, Illinois involving two Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad trains. Following the 1987 Chase, Maryland train collision, freight trains operating in enhanced-speed corridors have been required to have locomotive speed limiters to forcibly slow trains rather than simply alerting the operator with in-cab signals.

Frege was also influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to Edmund Husserl's 1891 book \"Philosophie der Arithmetik\", which argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them, Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the \"psychologism\" of Husserl's \"Philosophie\"). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\" (1884) and \"The Basic Laws of Arithmetic\" (, 1893\u20131903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u5206\u6790\u54f2\u5b66\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nPhilosophie der Arithmetik"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The verbal root \"budh-\" means \"to awaken,\" and its literal meaning is closer to \"awakening.\" Although its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism, the term \"buddhi\" is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term \"enlightenment\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max M\u00fcller. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u4ecf\u6559\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u609f\u308a\u3092\u958b\u3051\u3070\u4ecf\u306b\u306a\u308b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics. Although they made virtually no contributions to theoretical mathematics, the ancient Romans used applied mathematics in surveying, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, bookkeeping, creation of lunar and solar calendars, and even arts and crafts. Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system and the first use of negative numbers. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics through the work of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b. Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations. Contemporaneous with but independent of these traditions were the mathematics developed by the Maya civilization of Mexico and Central America, where the concept of zero was given a standard symbol in Maya numerals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u6570\u5b66\u306e\u767a\u7965\u306f\u3069\u3053\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nGreek"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He would incorporate some elements into his future work, particularly from the planned epos \"The Life of a Great Sinner\", which he began work on in the summer of 1869. It eventually remained unfinished after Dostoevsky was interested in the Nechayev affair, which involved a group of radicals murdering one of their former members. He picked up that story and started with \"Demons\". The unfinished \"Drama in Tobolsk\" (\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430. \u0412 \u0422\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0435) is considered the first draft of the first chapter of \"The Brothers Karamazov\". Dated 13 September 1874, it tells of a fictional murder in Staraya Russa committed by a \"praporshchik\" named Dmitry Ilynskov (based on a real soldier from Omsk), who is thought to have murdered his father. It goes on noting that his body was suddenly discovered in a pit under a house. The similarly unfinished \"Sorokoviny\" (\u0421\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044b), dated 1 August 1875, is reflected in book IX, chapter 3\u20135 and book XI, chapter nine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d5\u30e7\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30b9\u30c8\u30a8\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u304c\u30ab\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u30be\u30d5\u306e\u5144\u5f1f\u306e\u57f7\u7b46\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nApril 1878"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Reval withstood a Russian siege in 1570 and 1571, but several smaller towns were taken by Russian forces. On 23 January a Swedish army of 700 infantry and 600 cavalry under command of Clas \u00c5kesson Tott (the Elder) clashed with a Russian and Tartar army of 16,000 men under the command of Khan Sain-Bulat at the Battle of Lode by the village of Koluvere. The Russian advance concluded with the sacking of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1573, where, after its capture, the occupying forces roasted some of the leaders of the Swedish garrison alive, including the commander. This triggered a retaliatory campaign by John centred on Wesenberg, to which the army departed in November 1573 with Klas \u00c5kesson Tott in overall command and Pontus de la Gardie as field commander. There were also Russian raids into Finland, including one as far as Helsingfors (Helsinki) in 1572.

Little is known about Jordaens' early education. It can be assumed that he received the advantages of the education usually provided for children of his social class. This assumption is supported by his clear handwriting, his competence in French and in his knowledge of mythology. Jordaens familiarity with biblical subjects is evident in his many religious paintings, and his personal interest with the Bible was strengthened by his later conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. Like Rubens, he studied under Adam van Noort, who was his only teacher. During this time Jordaens lived in Van Noort's house in the Everdijstraat and became very close to the rest of the family. After eight years of training with Van Noort, he enrolled in the Guild of St. Luke as a \"\"waterschilder\"\", or watercolor artist. This medium was often used for preparing tapestry cartoons in the seventeenth century. although examples of his earliest watercolour works are no longer extant. In the same year as his entry into the guild, 1616, he married his teacher's eldest daughter, Anna Catharina van Noort, with whom he had three children. In 1618, Jordaens bought a house in Hoogstraat (the area in Antwerp that he grew up in). He would then later buy the adjoining house to expand his household and workspace in 1639, mimicking Rubens' house built two decades earlier. He lived and worked here until his death in 1678.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30e4\u30fc\u30b3\u30d6\u30fb\u30e8\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u51fa\u8eab\u968e\u7d1a\u306f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nwealthy"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Also known as the Rectangular Survey System, it was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, following the end of the American Revolution. Beginning with the Seven Ranges, in present-day Ohio, the PLSS has been used as the primary survey method in the United States. Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, in 1787, the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory. The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office, which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Today, the BLM controls the survey, sale, and settling of the new lands. Contrary to what some believe, the BLM does not manage the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS).

Water is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco () is derived from the Italian adjective \"fresco\" meaning \"fresh\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco.

In 1960, John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola's walkie-talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the first transistorized pager, and from that time, paging technology continued to advance, and pager adoption among emergency personnel is still popular, as of July 2016.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u304c\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1950"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability due to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater tuning stability, but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs from the sound of earlier gut strings.

Saruman's staff was famously broken in his parley with Gandalf the White at Orthanc. (Saruman did acquire another staff, but it had no special powers.) Gandalf the Grey's staff had also been broken, on the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm. Gandalf the Grey was inseparable from his staff; the name \"Gandalf\" means 'wand-elf' or 'staff-elf'. It was with him when he arrived in Middle-earth from the enchanted land of Valinor and he used its several powers on various occasions.

Members of this group began to practice jousting competitively, and their first tournament was held in 1997. Adams founded the World Championship Jousting Association (WCJA) as a body dedicated to jousting as a combat sport, which held its inaugural tournament in Port Elgin, Ontario on 24 July 1999. The sport is presented in the 2012 television show \"Full Metal Jousting\", hosted by Adams. The rules are inspired by \"Realgestech\" (also \"Plankengestech\"), one of the forms of \"stechen\" practised in 16th-century Germany, where reinforcing pieces were added to the jousting armour to serve as designated target areas. Instead of using a shield, the jousters aim for such a reinforcing piece added to the armour's left shoulder known as \"\" (also \"Stechtartsche\"). A number of Jousting events are held regularly in Europe, some organised by Arne Koets, including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at Schaffhausen.

There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for 500 years before rebirth.

The interview could have also been aimed at drawing out D\u00edaz's opponents so that they could be targeted by the regime. Yet another theory was to draw out D\u00edaz's supporters to persuade him to run again, although in 1910 he would be 80.

Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \"San\u0101tana Dharma\", \"the eternal tradition\", or the \"eternal way\", beyond human history. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \"Hindu synthesis\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE, after the end of the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE), and flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India.  Although Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, it is linked by shared concepts, recognisable rituals, cosmology, shared textual resources, and pilgrimage to sacred sites. Hindu texts are classified into \u015aruti (\"heard\") and Sm\u1e5bti (\"remembered\"). These texts discuss theology, philosophy, mythology, Vedic yajna, Yoga, agamic rituals, and temple building, among other topics. Major scriptures include the Vedas and Upanishads, the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and the \u0100gamas. Sources of authority and eternal truths in its texts play an important role, but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the understanding of these truths and to further develop the tradition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d2\u30f3\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u6559\u306f\u4ecf\u6559\u304b\u3089\u6d3e\u751f\u3057\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right. In the 2008 \"Name of Russia\" television show, Stalin was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history. A 2017 poll revealed that Stalin's popularity reached a 16-year high among the Russian population, with 46% expressing a favourable view of him. At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material. In this literature, Stalin's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat \"enemies of the people\" or the result of lower-level officials acting without Stalin's knowledge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u6587\u5b66\u306f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u306e\u7c9b\u6e05\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Prior to Staudinger's work, polymers were understood in terms of the association theory or aggregate theory, which originated with Thomas Graham in 1861. Graham proposed that cellulose and other polymers were colloids, aggregates of molecules having small molecular mass connected by an unknown intermolecular force. Hermann Staudinger was the first to propose that polymers consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. It took over a decade for Staudinger's work to gain wide acceptance in the scientific community, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f\u8ab0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nHermann Staudinger"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

It produces very high voltage direct current (DC) electricity at low current levels. It was invented by American physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff in 1929.  The potential difference achieved by modern Van de Graaff generators can be as much as 5 megavolts. A tabletop version can produce on the order of 100,000 volts and can store enough energy to produce a visible spark.

Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can only produce a child with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or O blood type. This most often led to inconclusive results, as only 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent under this form of testing. In the 1930s, a new form of blood testing, serological testing, which tests certain proteins in the blood, became available, with a 40% exclusion rate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u907a\u4f1d\u5b50\u691c\u67fb\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1920s"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of mutation, genetic recombination and other sources of genetic variation. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population. It is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms and molecules.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u5909\u5316\u3068\u9032\u5316\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306f\u4f55<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

This is made from tombak and was designed by Karl Hemmeter. The cross on the altar, by Peter Tauchnitz, is of gilt silver with 37 rock crystals. To the left of the altar is the baptismal font on a stand filled with Carrara marble which contains a majolica bowl for the holy water. To the right of the altar is an octagonal pulpit. Opposite the altar on a gallery is an organ containing about 5,000 pipes, which was built by Schuke. Plexiglas panels have been installed over the organ gallery to improve the acoustics. By the northeast wall of the church are three works of art. The first is a bronze plaque commemorating the Protestant martyrs who died during the Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945. It incorporates a Spanish wooden crucifix dating from the 13th century. The plaque was placed in the church on 20 July 1964, the 20th anniversary of an attempt to assassinate Hitler. Next to this is the \"Stalingrad Madonna\", a symbol of hope and reconciliation. This is a charcoal drawing made by Kurt Reuber during the time he was trapped inside Stalingrad at Christmas 1942. Copies of this drawing have been sent to Coventry Cathedral and the Russian Orthodox Church in Stalingrad (now Volgograd).

Her childhood home was at Burntisland, Fife. She was the second of four surviving children (three of her siblings had died in infancy). She was particularly close to her oldest brother Sam. The family lived in genteel poverty because her father's naval pay remained meagre as he rose through the ranks. Her mother supplemented the household's income by growing vegetables, maintaining an orchard and keeping cows for milk. Her mother taught her to read the Bible and Calvinist catechisms, and when not occupied with household chores Mary roamed among the birds and flowers in the garden. In her autobiography Somerville recollects that after returning from sea her father said to her mother \"This kind of life will never do, Mary must at least know how to write and keep accounts\". Thus the 10-year-old was sent for a year of tuition at Musselburgh, an expensive boarding school. Somerville learned the first principles of writing, rudimentary French and English grammar.

She was previously placed under house arrest by the country's ruling military junta in the former capital, Yangon on 19 July 1989 under martial law that allows for detention without charge or trial for three years. She was released on 10 July 1995 but re-arrested on 23 September 2000. On 6 May 2002 she was freed after nineteen months but on 30 May 2003, following the Depayin she was held in secret detention for over three months before being returned to house arrest. Despite global protests in solidarity her detention was extended by the Myanmar military junta for one year periods in 2007 and 2008.

EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u7b4b\u96fb\u56f3\u306f\u533b\u7642\u76ee\u7684\u3067\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

His nephew Edgar called himself King of the English and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of Britain. Simon Keynes argued that \"the consistent usages of Edgar's reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by \u00c6thelstan in the 930s\". Historian Charles Insley, however, sees \u00c6thelstan's hegemony as fragile: \"The level of overlordship wielded by \u00c6thelstan during the 930s over the rest of Britain was perhaps not attained again by an English king until Edward I.\" George Molyneaux argues that:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u521d\u4ee3\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u738b\u306f\u8ab0\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n\u00c6thelstan"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended. In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The 6-cylinder Chrysler was designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, was an automobile at an affordable price. Elements of this car are traceable to a prototype which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time. Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed, and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066\u751f\u7523\u3057\u305f\u8eca\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nChrysler automobile"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Innovations such as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions and better steering developed. Some commercially successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United Kingdom Locomotive Act (1865), which required many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively halted road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u8eca\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5f53\u521d\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u306f\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Japanese immigration to Hawaii began in 1868, and to the mainland in 1869. \"Issei\" parents, worrying about the increasing Americanization of their \"nisei\" children, established Japanese schools outside of the regular school system to teach the language and culture of their ancestral country. The first school was established in Kohala, Hawaii by Reverend Shigefusa Kanda, in 1893, and others soon followed, including several attached to Hawaiian Hongwanji missions. The schools were financed by both the Japanese immigrant community and the sugar planters they worked for, as they provided much needed childcare for the plantation laborers during their long workday. By 1920, the schools enrolled 98% of all Japanese American children in Hawaii. Statistics for 1934 showed 183 schools teaching a total of 41,192 students. On the mainland, the first Japanese language school was California's \"Nihongo Gakuin\", established in 1903; by 1912, eighteen such schools had been set up in California alone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u521d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821\u306f\u4f55<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nNihongo Gakuin"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Picasso's friend Ignacio Zuloaga (1870\u20131945) acquired El Greco's masterpiece, the \"Opening of the Fifth Seal\", in 1897 for 1000 pesetas. While Picasso was working on \"Les Demoiselles\", he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's \"Opening of the Fifth Seal.\" The relation between \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" and the \"Opening of the Fifth Seal\" was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs and visually identifying qualities of both works were analyzed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30b0\u30ec\u30b3\u304c\u4e16\u9593\u306b\u8a8d\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u304d\u3063\u304b\u3051\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u306f\u4f55<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nOpening of the Fifth Seal"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Over 16,000 Cherokee were forcibly relocated westward to Indian Territory in 1838\u20131839, a migration known as the Trail of Tears or in Cherokee or (\"The Trail Where They Cried\"), although it is described by another word (\"The Removal\"). Marched over across Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas, the people suffered from disease, exposure and starvation, and as many as 4,000 died. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears.

Commercial games followed in the next decade, with \"Islands of Kesmai\", the first commercial online role-playing game, debuting in 1984, as well as more graphical games, such as the MSX LINKS action games in 1986, the flight simulator \"Air Warrior\" in 1987, and the Famicom Modem's online Go game in 1987. The rapid availability of the Internet in the 1990s led to an expansion of online games, with notable titles including \"\" (1996), \"Quakeworld\" (1996), \"Ultima Online\" (1997), \"Lineage\" (1998), \"Starcraft\" (1998), \"Counter-Strike\" (1999) and \"EverQuest\" (1999). Video game consoles also began to receive online networking features, such as the Famicom Modem (1987), Sega Meganet (1990), Satellaview (1995), SegaNet (1996), PlayStation 2 (2000) and Xbox (2001).

It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, as three volumes. (This first edition is available in facsimile.) The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801\u20131810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875\u20131889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the \"Britannica\" shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the \"Britannica\" became the first encyclopaedia to adopt \"continuous revision\", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30d6\u30ea\u30bf\u30cb\u30ab\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u5178\u306f\u4f55\u5e74\u306b\u4e00\u5ea6\u51fa\u7248\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nbetween 1768 and 1771"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes reduced to the \"ubiquinol\" form (QH); when QH releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the \"ubiquinone\" (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced on one side of the membrane and QH oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30e6\u30d3\u30ad\u30ce\u30f3\u306f\u4eba\u4f53\u306b\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit (LEO) by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments; while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space Age. Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layer's density, through measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite's false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1\/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometers (18,000 mi) per hour, taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u521d\u3081\u3066\u7121\u4eba\u60d1\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u304c\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3044\u3064<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n4 October 1957"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Inclusion rejects but still provides the use of special schools or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities. Schools with inclusive classrooms do not believe in separate classrooms.

Even after the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767, many literary masterpieces in the Thai language survived. However, Ayutthayan literature (as well as Thai literature before the modern era) was dominated by verse composition (i.e., poetry), whereas prose works were reserved to legal matters, records of state affairs and historical chronicles. Thus, there are many works in the nature of epic poetry in the Thai language. The Thai poetical tradition was originally based on indigenous poetical forms such as \"rai\" (\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22), \"khlong\" (\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07), \"kap\" (\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c) and \"klon\" (\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19). Some of these poetical forms\u2014notably \"Khlong\"\u2014have been shared between the speakers of tai languages since ancient time (before the emergence of Siam).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30a2\u30e6\u30bf\u30e4\u738b\u671d\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u306f\u3042\u3063\u305f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nrich in literary production"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

One of the studies published in his essay involved a young woman by the name of Anna O. Among her many ailments, she suffered from stiff paralysis on the right side of her body. Freud stated her symptoms to be attached to psychological traumas. The painful memories had separated from her consciousness and brought harm to her body. Freud used hypnosis to treat Anna O. She is reported to have gained slight mobility on her right side. Freud's repressed memory theory joined his philosophy of psychoanalysis.

Powered by the Turbo Air 6 engine with and mated to a three-speed manual or optional extra-cost two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six-cylinder full-sized Chevrolet Biscayne. The Corvair's unique design included the \"Quadri-Flex\" independent suspension and \"Unipack Power Team\" of engine, transmission, and rear axle combined into a single unit. Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and others, \"Quadri-Flex\" used coil springs at all four wheels with independent rear suspension arms incorporated at the rear. Specially designed 6.5 by 13 in. four-ply tires mounted on 13 in wheels with 5.5 in width were standard equipment. Available options included RPO 360, the Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission ($146), RPO 118, a gasoline heater ($74), RPO 119, an AM tube radio ($54), and by February 1960, the rear folding seat (formerly $32) was standard. Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960. In January 1960, two two-door coupe models were introduced designated as the 527 and 727 models. Following the success of the upmarket \"Mr. and Mrs. Monza\" styling concept cars at the 1960 Chicago Auto Show, management approved the neatly appointed bucket-seat DeLuxe trim of the 900 series Monza as a two-door club coupe only. This model began arriving at showroom floors in April 1960. Despite their late January introduction of the coupe, these cars sold well; about 14,628 base model 527 coupes, 36,562 727 deluxe coupes, and 11,926 927 Monza club coupes, making the coupe one of the most popular Corvairs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u30b7\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30fb\u30b3\u30eb\u30f4\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u767a\u58f2\u5f53\u521d\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u306f\uff1f<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nunder $2,000"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Overseen by Antin, Interscope, and various partners, the group was transformed into a global image and commercial brand. The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with hit singles \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\", \"Stickwitu\", and their first album \"PCD\". However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members.

Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was allowed in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"Carriers\" to use US technology. Hence there is no \"development\" in the US in mobile messaging service. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services (PCS) \u2013 what the ITU frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT \u2013 Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications \u2013 1000-feet range picocell, but survived. American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America, provided the first text-messaging service in the United States. Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses. APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on November 15, 1995 in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland. Vice President Al Gore in Washington, D.C. made the initial phone-call to launch the network, calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u4f55<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nSMS messaging"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity.

John Hunt Morgan, and he re-enlisted in the army as a private in the 9th Kentucky Cavalry in May 1862. Morgan recognized Hines' talents and commissioned him as a captain on June 10, 1862. Afterward, Hines spent most of his time engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky.

The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.  The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes \u2013 the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Montako osaa ihmisen aivoissa on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\ncerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In antiquity, the Roman Via Egnatia passed through Epirus Nova, which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to Dyrrachium on the Adriatic Sea. The modern Egnatia highway, which links Ioannina to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at Igoumenitsa, is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region's isolation from the east, while the Ionia highway, connecting Epirus with Western Greece, helped reducing the region's isolation from the south. Also, the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near Preveza, with Aetolia-Acarnania in western Greece. Ferry services from Igoumenitsa to the Ionian islands and Italy exist. The only airport in Epirus is the Ioannina National Airport, while the Aktion National Airport is located just south of Preveza in Aetolia-Acarnania.

Historically, the terms \"burgher\" and \"Boer\" have both been used to describe white Afrikaans speakers as a group; neither is particularly objectionable but Afrikaner has been considered a more appropriate term. The term was in common usage in both the Boer republics and the Cape Colony by the late nineteenth century. At one time, \"burghers\" merely denoted \"Cape Dutch\", settlers who were influential in the administration, able to participate in urban affairs, and did so regularly. \"Boers\" often referred to the settled European farmers or nomadic cattle herders. During the Batavian Republic, \"burgher\" was popularised among Dutch communities both at home and abroad as a popular revolutionary form of address, or \"citizen\".

The family of Cleinias had old connections with the Spartan aristocracy through a relationship of \"xenia\", and the name \"Alcibiades\" was of Spartan origin. Alcibiades' mother was Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles, head of the powerful Alcmaeonid family, and could trace her family back to Eurysaces and the Telamonian Ajax. Alcibiades thereby, through his mother, belonged to the powerful and controversial family of the Alcmaeonidae; the renowned Pericles and his brother Ariphron were Deinomache's cousins, as her father and their mother were siblings. His maternal grandfather, also named Alcibiades, was a friend of Cleisthenes, the famous constitutional reformer of the late 6th century BC.

The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the \"stationary state\", originally used in classical economics; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new ecological feature, presently also used in the academic discipline of ecological economics. The \"durability\" of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy \u2014 something desirable by itself \u2014 maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate.

As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work. Phenomenology is not a unitary movement; rather, different authors share a common family resemblance but also with many significant differences. Gabriella Farina states:A unique and final definition of phenomenology is dangerous and perhaps even paradoxical as it lacks a thematic focus. In fact, it is not a doctrine, nor a philosophical school, but rather a style of thought, a method, an open and ever-renewed experience having different results, and this may disorient anyone wishing to define the meaning of phenomenology.Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 fenomenologia on saanut alkunsa?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n20th century by Edmund Husserl"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers.

Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture, and also for some non-agricultural societies. In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church. In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades. The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mik\u00e4 on tavanomaisin kyl\u00e4n m\u00e4\u00e4ritelm\u00e4?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\na clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard \"Vostok 1\") in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (\"Salyut 1\") in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Min\u00e4 vuonna avaruutta tutkittiin ensimm\u00e4isen kerran?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n4 October 1957"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In presenting the activity or device, the thematic interpreter develops the theme in such a way that it will be highly relevant to an audience.

This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue. A very high radiation dose over a short period of time causes radiation sickness, while lower doses can give an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer. In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination.

Around 300 BCE, people of the central and southeastern area of Mesoamerica began to gather into larger settlements. Teotihuacan was the largest urban center of Mesoamerica before the Aztecs, almost 1000 years prior to their epoch. The city was already in ruins by the time of the Aztecs. For many years, archaeologists believed it was built by the Toltec. This belief was based on colonial period texts, such as the Florentine Codex, which attributed the site to the Toltecs. However, the Nahuatl word \"Toltec\" generally means \"craftsman of the highest level\" and may not always refer to the Toltec civilization centered at Tula, Hidalgo. Since Toltec civilization flourished centuries after Teotihuacan, the people could not have been the city's founders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Ketk\u00e4 intiaanit rakensivat Teotihuac\u00e1nin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nuncertain"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

J. Abrams and four Emmys for the pilot episode. The series also won Outstanding Drama Series, which was considered a surprise win because the Emmys had rarely recognized science fiction or fantasy programs in the category. The following year, the series was nominated for nine Emmys, but failed to win any. Despite winning for Outstanding Drama Series the previous year, \"Lost\" was not nominated in the category in 2006. This was referenced in host Conan O'Brien's opening segment for the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards where he lands on a beach and discovers Jorge Garcia. O'Brien jumps into a hatch and invites Garcia to come along to the ceremony, but Garcia says \"we weren't exactly invited,\" to which O'Brien responds: \"but you won last year, nothing makes sense anymore!\" In 2007, the series was nominated for six Emmys, but again failed to gain a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series. Terry O'Quinn became the first \"Lost\" actor to win an Emmy Award, picking up the trophy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as John Locke in \"The Man from Tallahassee\". In 2008, the series gained eight nominations, of which six were Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour). In 2009, the series received six nominations and won two. Michael Emerson became the second actor from \"Lost\" to win the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Ben Linus in \"Dead Is Dead\". The website DharmaWantsYou.com won a special award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media \u2013 Fiction. In 2010, the sixth and final season of \"Lost\" received thirteen nominations, including a fourth Outstanding Drama Series nomination, which it lost to the third season of \"Mad Men\" as in the two previous years.

Marketed as the \"Runabout,\" the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062. The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five decorative chrome strips, pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately as large as the sedan's, and a fold down seat \u2014 a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be supplemented for 1977\u20131980 with an optional rear hatch that was entirely glass.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mik\u00e4 on Yhdysvaltain suosituin automalli vuodesta 1977 l\u00e4htien?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nFord"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Early taxonomists such as Linnaeus had no option but to describe what they saw: this was later formalised as the typological or morphological species concept. Mayr emphasised reproductive isolation, but this, like other species concepts, is hard or even impossible to test. Later biologists have tried to refine Mayr's definition with the recognition and cohesion concepts, among others. Many of the concepts are quite similar or overlap, so they are not easy to count: the biologist R. L. Mayden recorded about 24 concepts, and the philosopher of science John Wilkins counted 26. Wilkins further grouped the species concepts into seven basic kinds of concepts: (1) agamospecies for asexual organisms (2) biospecies for reproductively isolated sexual organisms (3) ecospecies based on ecological niches (4) evolutionary species based on lineage (5) genetic species based on gene pool (6) morphospecies based on form or phenotype and (7) taxonomic species, a species as determined by a taxonomist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Montako laji k\u00e4sitett\u00e4 on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nseven"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes. Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues. The Social Links were originally called but this was changed as the word \"Community\" had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as \"society\" and \"bonds\". Some in-game Easter egg references were also changed: in \"Persona 3\" references to \"Shin Megami Tensei\" by a character in an in-game MMORPG were changed to reference earlier \"Persona\" games, while mentions of a fictional detective in \"Persona 4\" were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from \"Eternal Punishment\" and the \"Devil Summoner\" series. Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of \"Persona 4\" character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal more to a western audience. \"Persona 5\" is planned to be localized in this fashion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Onko Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 japanilainen peli?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nJapanese"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The government area surrounding a castle was called a \"slottsl\u00e4n\" (\"linnal\u00e4\u00e4ni\" in Finnish). Sweden was an electoral kingdom in mediaeval times and the election was held at the stones of Mora.

It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller \"Canis\" species, such as the coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of \"Canis\" to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.

To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west to Los Angeles, where attempts to enforce Edison's patents were more easily evade, because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2013which covered most of Southern California\u2013was known to rule against patent claims.

The higher level is made up of a limestone cliff running along the coast, with a plateau in the centre of the island reaching approximately 60 metres (200 feet) high above sea level. The lower level is a coastal terrace approximately 0.5 km (0.3 miles) wide and about 25\u201327 metres (80\u201390 feet) high, which slopes down and meets the sea in small cliffs. A coral reef surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, Alofi.

Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. The earliest known texts on geometry are the Egyptian \"Rhind Papyrus\" (2000\u20131800 BC) and \"Moscow Papyrus\" (c. 1890 BC), the Babylonian clay tablets such as Plimpton 322 (1900 BC). For example, the Moscow Papyrus gives a formula for calculating the volume of a truncated pyramid, or frustum. Later clay tablets (350\u201350 BC) demonstrate that Babylonian astronomers implemented trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and motion within time-velocity space. These geometric procedures anticipated the Oxford Calculators, including the mean speed theorem, by 14 centuries. South of Egypt the ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Miss\u00e4 geometrinen struktuuri kehitettiin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nMesopotamia and Egypt"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question. In 1960, Portugal was ruled by the Estado Novo government of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar. The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly anti-communist, suppressing enemies of the state as anti-Portuguese. In his significant newspaper article \"The Forgotten Prisoners\", Benenson later described his reaction as follows: Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government...

It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian theology within the monastic schools at the earliest European universities.

The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great, which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings. For Muslims, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his steed, al-Buraq, on his night journey to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the Western border of \"al-Haram al-Sharif\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Ketk\u00e4 rakensivat l\u00e4nsimuurin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nHerod the Great"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \"San\u0101tana Dharma\", \"the eternal tradition\", or the \"eternal way\", beyond human history. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \"Hindu synthesis\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE, after the end of the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE), and flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India.  Although Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, it is linked by shared concepts, recognisable rituals, cosmology, shared textual resources, and pilgrimage to sacred sites. Hindu texts are classified into \u015aruti (\"heard\") and Sm\u1e5bti (\"remembered\"). These texts discuss theology, philosophy, mythology, Vedic yajna, Yoga, agamic rituals, and temple building, among other topics. Major scriptures include the Vedas and Upanishads, the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and the \u0100gamas. Sources of authority and eternal truths in its texts play an important role, but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the understanding of these truths and to further develop the tradition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mik\u00e4 on maailman vanhin uskonto jota harjoitetaan viel\u00e4kin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nHinduism"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Pad thai has since become one of Thailand's national dishes. Today, some food vendors add pork or chicken (although the original recipe did not contain pork because of the government's perception that pork was a Chinese meat).

Renewed Soviet attacks failed, and in spring, the Estonian army, in cooperation with White Russian forces, advanced into Russia and Latvia. In June 1919, Estonia defeated the German Landeswehr which had attempted to dominate Latvia, restoring power to the government of K\u0101rlis Ulmanis there. After the collapse of the White Russian forces, the Red Army launched a major offensive against Narva in late 1919, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.

Because the pancreas is a vital organ, performing functions necessary in the digestion process, the recipient's native pancreas is left in place, and the donated pancreas is attached in a different location. In the event of rejection of the new pancreas, which would quickly cause life-threatening diabetes, there would be a significant chance the recipient would not survive very well for long without the native pancreas, however dysfunctional, still in place. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a partial pancreas from a living donor. At present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes, who can develop severe complications. Patients with the most common, and deadliest, form of pancreatic cancer (pancreatic adenomas, which are usually malignant, with a poor prognosis and high risk for metastasis, as opposed to more treatable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic insulinomas) are usually not eligible for valuable pancreatic transplantations, since the condition usually has a very high mortality rate and the disease, which is usually highly malignant and detected too late to treat, could and probably would soon return. Better surgical method can be chosen to minimize the surgical complications with enteric or bladder drainage. Advancement in immunosuppression has improved quality of life after transplantation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Voiko ihminen el\u00e4\u00e4 ilman haimaa?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The central event at Porvoo was the sovereign pledge and the oaths of the Estates in Porvoo Cathedral on 29 March. Each of the Estates swore their oaths of allegiance, committing themselves to accepting the Emperor as Grand Prince of Finland as the true authority, and to keeping the constitution and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promised to govern Finland in accordance with its laws and let the Finnish keep their religion and rights.

Despite these massive numbers there was still no formal requirements for being a physician. At this point all physicians were either self-taught or learned their trade through an apprenticeship. Despite this, there was an attempt at organization, as the army did have a medical manual that was passed out to its physicians. The Medici were used on both the front line as emergency care providers and in the rear as the main physicians.

The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800\u20131050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19th century.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 hevoset ovat tulleet Suomeen?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n800\u20131050 CE"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The earliest crossbows in the world were invented in ancient China and caused a major shift in the role of projectile weaponry. The traditional bow and arrow had long been a specialized weapon that required considerable training, physical strength and expertise to operate with any degree of practical efficiency. In many cultures, archers were considered a separate and superior warrior caste, despite usually being drawn from the common class, as their archery skill-set was essentially trained and strengthened from birth (similar to many horseman cultures) and was impossible to reproduce outside a pre-established cultural tradition, which many nations lacked. In contrast, the crossbow was the first ranged weapon to be simple, cheap and physically undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of untrained conscript soldiers, thus enabling virtually any nation to field a potent force of crossbowmen with little expense beyond the cost of the weapons themselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Miss\u00e4 jalkajousi keksittiin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nancient China"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The IOM does not distinguish between K and K \u2013 both are counted as vitamin K. At that time, sufficient information was not available to establish EARs and RDAs for vitamin K. In instances such as these, the board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AIs for adult women and men ages 19 and up are 90 and 120 \u03bcg\/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 90 \u03bcg\/day. AI for lactation is 90 \u03bcg\/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 2.0-2.5 \u03bcg\/day; for children ages 1\u201318 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 \u03bcg\/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Vitamin K has no UL, as human data for adverse effects from high doses are inadequate.

However, the original DDR technology tops out at a clock rate around 200 MHz (400 MT\/s). Higher performance DDR chips exist, but JEDEC has stated that they will not be standardized. These chips are mostly standard DDR chips that have been tested and rated to be capable of operation at higher clock rates by the manufacturer. Such chips draw significantly more power than slower-clocked chips, but usually offered little or no improvement in real-world performance.

(The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and North America was \"Dutch roof.\") The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle, while the lower slope is steep. This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the Medieval Latin word \"gamba\", meaning \"horse's hock or leg\". The term \"gambrel\" is of American origin, the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard. In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called Dutch gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves, Swedish ~, German ~, English ~ , French ~, or New England gambrel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Miten mansardikatto m\u00e4\u00e4ritell\u00e4\u00e4n?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nusually symmetrical two-sided roof with two slopes on each side"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

It also emerged in other areas of the East Coast of the United States and several other major metropolitan areas (such as New Orleans and Chicago) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. Neapolitan, Calabrian, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with Italian organized crime groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra of Naples, and 'Ndrangheta of Calabria. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"family,\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known.

Set primarily in the then-future year of 1979, it revolves around the eponymous Carrie White, an unpopular friendless misfit and bullied high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her. While in this process, she causes one of the worst local disasters the town has ever had. King has commented that he finds the work to be \"raw\" and \"with a surprising power to hurt and horrify.\" It is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools. Much of the book uses newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her sadistic classmates and her own mother Margaret.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 Carrie -romaani kertoo?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nrevolves around the eponymous Carrie White, an unpopular friendless misfit and bullied high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

These were intended to prevent such eugenics and neo-eugenics as resulted in the involuntary sterilization of large groups of poor and minority women. Such practices include: not conveying to patients that sterilization is permanent and irreversible, in their own language (including the option to end the process or procedure at any time without conceding any future medical attention or federal benefits, the ability to ask any and all questions about the procedure and its ramifications, the requirement that the consent seeker describes the procedure fully including any and all possible discomforts and\/or side-effects and any and all benefits of sterilization); failing to provide alternative information about methods of contraception, family planning, or pregnancy termination that are nonpermanent and\/or irreversible (this includes abortion); conditioning receiving welfare and\/or Medicaid benefits by the individual or his\/her children on the individuals \"consenting\" to permanent sterilization; tying elected abortion to compulsory sterilization (cannot receive a sought out abortion without \"consenting\" to sterilization); using hysterectomy as sterilization; and subjecting minors and the mentally incompetent to sterilization. The regulations also include an extension of the informed consent waiting period from 72 hours to 30 days (with a maximum of 180 days between informed consent and the sterilization procedure).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Onko pakkosterilointi laillista USA:ssa?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In 1940 Adolph Murie published \"Ecology of the Coyote in the Yellowstone National Park\". That study and his 1940\u201341 work \"The Wolves of Mount McKinley\" was instrumental in building a scientific foundation for wolf conservation. In 1944, noted wildlife biologist Aldo Leopold, once an avid predator control advocate, made the following comments in his review of \"The Wolves of North America\", Young and Goldman, 1944: By the 1960s, cultural and scientific understanding of ecosystems was changing attitudes toward the wolf and other large predators. In part, this included the emergence of Robert Paine's concept of the keystone species. In the early 1960s, Douglas Pimlott, a noted Canadian wildlife biologist was calling for the restorations of wolves in the northern rockies. In 1970 American wolf expert, David Mech published \"The Wolf: The Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species\" (1970, 1981), an enlightening study of the wolf and its impact on its environment. In 1978, when wildlife biologist John Weaver published his seminal study \"Wolves of Yellowstone\", he concluded the report with the following recommendation: The gray wolf was one of the first species to be listed as endangered (1967) under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. However, until the passage of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, there was no legal basis or process for re-introducing the gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The Endangered Species Act obligated the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop restoration plans for each species designated as \"Endangered\". The first recovery plan was completed in 1980 but gained little traction. In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a revised \"Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan\" which led the way to wolf reintroduction. The plan was a cooperative effort between the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, academia, state wildlife agencies and environmental groups. Its Executive Summary contains the following: In 1991 Congress directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the express purpose of reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone National Park and regions of Central Idaho. The final statement was published on April 14, 1994 and seriously examined five potential alternatives for reestablishing wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: El\u00e4\u00e4k\u00f6 Yellowstonen kansallispuistossa susia?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

When Manuel died, he was succeeded by his young son Alexios II Komnenos, who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria. Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Manuel's estranged cousin, Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1183\u20131185), son of Isaac Komnenos. Andronikos left his retirement in 1182, and marched on Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents. His arrival was soon followed by a massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the Venetian merchants who were settled in some numbers in Constantinople. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister Maria the Porphyrogenita and her husband Renier of Montferrat, although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene. The poisoner was said to be the eunuch Pterygeonites. Soon afterwards he had the empress Maria imprisoned and then killed, by Pterygeonites and the \"hetaireiarches\" Constantine Tripsychos. Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire, but was then put to death; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos and Stephen Hagiochristophorites. Andronikos, by 1183 sole emperor, married Agnes of France, a child twelve years of age who had been formerly betrothed to Alexios II. Agnes was a daughter of King Louis VII of France and his third wife Ad\u00e8le of Champagne. By November 1183, Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuka hallitsi Aleksios I Komnenos ennen?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nManuel"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death. Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan. Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as an archer, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year, and he was taken to Merv to be buried next to his father, Chaghri Beg.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin Alp Arslan kuoli?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n25 November 1072"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13; for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13. In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to any number of factors, including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition, or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens, which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors. Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty, and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuinka kauan puberteetti keskim\u00e4\u00e4rin kest\u00e4\u00e4?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nages 10\u201311 and end puberty around 15\u201317; boys begin around ages 11\u201312 and end around 16\u201317"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

It may be taken by mouth or by injection. The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements. Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folic acid deficiency. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the baby. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs. More than 80 countries use fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs. Long-term supplementation is also associated with small reductions in the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. No common side effects are known. Concerns exist that large amounts of folic acid might hide vitamin B deficiency. Folic acid is essential for the body to make DNA, RNA, and metabolise amino acids, which are required for cell division. Not consuming enough folate can lead to folate deficiency. This may result in a type of anemia in which low numbers of large red blood cells occur. Symptoms may include feeling tired, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, open sores on the tongue, and changes in the color of the skin or hair. Folate deficiency in children may develop within a month of poor dietary intake. In adults, normal total body folate is between 10 and 30 mg with blood levels of greater than 7 nmol\/L (3 ng\/mL). Folate is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost of supplements in the developing world is between US$0.001 and 0.005 per dose as of 2014. The term \"folic\" is from the Latin word (which means leaf) because it was found in dark-green leafy vegetables.

Conventional armed resistance to the German invasion ended on 10 June 1940 and the Germans controlled Norway until the capitulation of German forces in Europe on 8\/9 May 1945. Throughout this period, Norway was continuously occupied by the \"Wehrmacht\". Civil rule was effectively assumed by the \"Reichskommissariat Norwegen\" (Reich Commissariat of Norway), which acted in collaboration with a pro-German puppet government, the Quisling regime, while the Norwegian King Haakon VII and the prewar government escaped to London, where they acted as a government in exile. This period of military occupation is in Norway referred to as the \"war years\" or \"occupation period\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Valloittiko Saksa koko Norjan vuonna 1940?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Italian troops entered Rome in 1870, thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power. Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions. However, even if relations with Berlin became very friendly, the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste, corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians. So in 1915, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers, as the western powers promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria-Hungary) for participation that was more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality.

The requirements for making a good mirror are a surface with a very high degree of flatness (preferably but not necessarily with high reflectivity), and a surface roughness smaller than the wavelength of the light. The earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of polished stone such as obsidian, a naturally occurring volcanic glass. Examples of obsidian mirrors found in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) have been dated to around 6000 B.C. Mirrors of polished copper were crafted in Mesopotamia from 4000 B.C., and in ancient Egypt from around 3000 B.C. Polished stone mirrors from Central and South America date from around 2000 B.C. onwards. In China, bronze mirrors were manufactured from around 2000 B.C., some of the earliest bronze and copper examples being produced by the Qijia culture. Mirrors made of other metal mixtures (alloys) such as copper and tin speculum metal may have also been produced in China and India. Mirrors of speculum metal or any precious metal were hard to produce and were only owned by the wealthy. These stone and metal mirrors could be made in very large sizes, but were difficult to polish and get perfectly flat; a process that became more difficult with increased size; so they often produced warped or blurred images. Stone mirrors often had poor reflectivity compared to metals, yet metals scratch or tarnish easily, so they frequently needed polishing. Depending upon the color, both often yielded reflections with poor color rendering. The poor image quality of ancient mirrors explains 1 Corinthians 13's reference to seeing \"as in a mirror, darkly.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin peili keksittiin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n6000 B.C."},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

There were many physicists, especially the \"old guard\", who were suspicious of the intuitive meanings of Einstein's theories. While the response to Einstein was based in part on his concepts being a radical break from earlier theories, there was also an anti-Jewish element to some of the criticism. The leading theoretician of the \"Deutsche Physik\" type of movement was Rudolf Tomaschek, who had re-edited the famous physics textbook \"Grimsehl's Lehrbuch der Physik\". In that book, which consists of several volumes, the Lorentz transformation was accepted, as well as quantum theory. However, Einstein's interpretation of the Lorentz transformation was not mentioned, and Einstein's name was completely ignored. Many classical physicists resented Einstein's dismissal of the notion of a luminiferous aether, which had been a mainstay of their work for the majority of their productive lives. They were not convinced by the empirical evidence for relativity. They believed that the measurements of the perihelion of Mercury and the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment might be explained in other ways, and the results of the Eddington eclipse experiment were experimentally problematic enough to be dismissed as meaningless by the more devoted doubters. Many of them were very distinguished experimental physicists, and Lenard was himself a Nobel laureate in physics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Miksi arjalainen fysiikka vastusti kvanttimekaniikkaa?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nanti-Jewish element"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Miten renessanssin taide m\u00e4\u00e4ritell\u00e4\u00e4n?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\npainting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

France's latest aircraft carrier, the \"R91 Charles de Gaulle\", is nuclear-powered. The United Kingdom rejected nuclear power early in the development of its \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carriers on cost grounds, as even several decades of fuel use costs less than a nuclear reactor. Since 1949 the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been one of the lead laboratories in the development of the nuclear navy.

The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP (PPP) was the second largest in the world, and 3rd in the world during the mid-1980s to 1989, although per-capita it was behind that of First World countries.

Anxiety is a worry about future events, and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder. The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, family history of mental disorders, and poverty. Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present for at least 6 months, be more than what would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism; heart disease; caffeine, alcohol, or cannabis use; and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others. Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta blockers, may improve symptoms. About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year, and between 5% and 30% are affected at some point in their life. They occur about twice as often in females as males and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common are specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life. They affect those between the ages 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuinka monta ahdistuneisuush\u00e4iri\u00f6t\u00e4 on olemassa?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, \"History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America\". In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species in other parts of the world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus \"Enaliarctos\" and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under Carnivora. Of the three extant families, the Otariidae and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 tulee nimitys ev\u00e4jalkainen?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nThe German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In 1811, Alexander I incorporated Russian Vyborg province into the Grand Duchy of Finland. During the Russian era, the Finnish language began to gain recognition. From the 1860s onwards, a strong Finnish nationalist movement known as the Fennoman movement grew. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's national epic \u2013 the \"Kalevala\" \u2013 in 1835, and the Finnish language's achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892. The Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868 killed 15% of the population, making it one of the worst famines in European history. The famine led the Russian Empire to ease financial regulations, and investment rose in following decades. Economic and political development was rapid.

The set of underlying constants is modified as more stable constants are found, or may be more precisely measured. For example, in 1983 the metre was redefined as the distance that light propagates in vacuum in a given fraction of a second, thus making the value of the speed of light in terms of the defined units exact. The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of electrostatic units and electromagnetic units) and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: \" \u2013 CGPM), which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS. Since then, the SI has been adopted by all countries except the United States, Liberia and Myanmar.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin SI-j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4 kehitetty?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1960"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In 1938 a ski was found from Salla, Finland that has been dated back to 3245 BCE. Noted examples are the Kalvtr\u00e4skskidan ski, found in Sweden and dated to 3300 BCE, and the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in Norway and dated to 3200 BCE. There are some 20 findings of ancient, well-preserved skis in drained bogs in Norway, indicating that skis have been widely used in Norway, particularly Northern Norway, since prehistoric times. Skis have also been uncovered in ancient graves. In 2014, a ski complete with leather bindings, emerged from a glacier in Reinheimen mountains, Norway. The binding is at a small elevated area in the middle of the 172 cm long and 14,5 cm wide ski. According to the report the ski is some 1300 years old. A large number of organic artifacts have been well preserved for several thousand years by the stable glaciers of Oppland county and emerge when glaciers recede. A ski excavated in Greenland is dated to 1010. Based on findings in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, researchers have identified at least 3 main types: arctic, southern and central Nordic. The arctic type was short and covered with fur, and used from northern Japan in the east to Ob river in the west. The Sami people probably brought this type to the Nordic region. The southern type had one short and one long ski, and was used in forest areas of Southern Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. The central Nordic type also had one short with fur (the \"andor\") and one long, and was used in large parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuinka pitk\u00e4 muinaissuksi on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n172 cm long and 14,5 cm"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

One potential issue associated with high doses of folic acid is that it has a masking effect on the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia due to vitamin B deficiency. An additional concern raised was that low vitamin B status in combination with high folic acid intake appeared to increase the risk of cognitive impairment. The IOM sets ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. The adult UL of 1000 \u03bcg for folate (and lower for children) refers to folic acid used as a supplement, as no health risks have been associated with high intake of folate from food sources. The EFSA reviewed the safety question and agreed with United States that the UL be set at 1000 \u03bcg. The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition set the adult UL at 1,300 or 1,400 \u03bcg depending on age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Onko foolihappo toksista ihmiselle?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

While moored there, she was torpedoed and badly damaged by Japanese midget submarines. In 1944, she was updated for coastal bombardment duties, which she performed later that year during the Normandy landings in June and the invasion of southern France in August. In January 1945, the worn-out battleship was withdrawn from service and used as a barracks ship attached to the training establishment .

From June 1793 to July 1794 (the Reign of Terror) about 17,000 people were guillotined. Former King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were executed at the guillotine in 1793. Towards the end of the Terror in 1794, revolutionary leaders such as Georges Danton, Saint-Just and Maximilian Robespierre were sent to the guillotine. Most of the time, executions in Paris were carried out in the Place de la Revolution (former Place Louis XV and current Place de la Concorde); the guillotine stood in the corner near the H\u00f4tel Crillon where the statue of Brest can be found today. The machine was moved several times, to the Place de la Nation, the Place de la Bastille but returned especially for the assassination of the king and for Robespierre. For a time, executions by guillotine were a popular form of entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators, with vendors selling programs listing the names of the condemned. But more than popular entertainment alone, during the Reign of Terror, the guillotine symbolized revolutionary ideals: equality in death equivalent to equality before the law, open and demonstrable revolutionary justice, and the destruction of privilege under the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" which included separate forms of execution for the nobility. As such, the guillotine was considered a positive force for progress by the Parisian \"sans-culottes\", the popular public face of lower-class patriotic radicalism in the French Revolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin giljotiini\u00e4 aloitettiin k\u00e4ytt\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4n?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n21 August 1792"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

As the Soviet system was being dismantled, well-placed bosses and technocrats in the Communist Party, KGB, and Komsomol (Soviet Youth League) were cashing in on their Soviet-era power and privileges. Some quietly liquidated the assets of their organization and secreted the proceeds in overseas accounts and investments. Others created banks and business in Russia, taking advantage of their insider positions to win exclusive government contracts and licenses and to acquire financial credits and supplies at artificially low, state-subsidized prices in order to transact business at high, market-value prices.

With Ferrari's season marred by the death of Gilles Villeneuve at Zolder, the career-ending injuries to Didier Pironi at Hockenheim and the turbocharged Brabham-BMW and Renault cars suffering from poor reliability (and not helped by Brabham continually changing between the Ford V8 and the BMW turbo), consistency won Rosberg the Drivers' Championship, despite his Williams FW07C using the normally aspirated Ford DFY V8 engine which was considered outdated and out-matched against the vastly more powerful turbo cars. Rosberg won the championship with a five-point gap to Didier Pironi, with the latter missing the last four races of the championship due to injuries sustained at the German Grand Prix. Rosberg's 1982 Championship proved to be the last World Championship win for the old Cosworth DFV engine which had been introduced to F1 by Lotus in (the DFY was a development of the DFV). Rosberg's post-championship years would be hamstrung by both uncompetitive chassis from Williams, and the powerful but unreliable Honda turbo engine. For his title defense in , Rosberg was again using the reliable Ford DFY V8. However, by this time, Ferrari, Renault and BMW had got their act together and the reliability of their turbo engines was starting to match their speed and power output. Rosberg still put his Williams FW08 on pole for the opening race of the season in Brazil (where he was disqualified from 2nd place because he was push started in the pits after he was forced to abandon his car in his pit bay due to a fuel vapor fire), and then won both the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch and in Monaco thanks to a clever choice of slicks at the start when all others started on wets, but it was increasingly obvious that without a turbo charged engine, results would be scarce. To that end, Frank Williams concluded a deal to run the Honda V6 turbo engine in his cars. Honda had come back into Formula One that year with the Spirit team and results had been slow with unreliability, but they were enthusiastic about joining Williams who had a reputation as a Championship-winning team. Rosberg and teammate Jacques Laffite first got their Honda turbos in the season ending South African Grand Prix at Kyalami and immediately the new Williams FW09 was on the pace. Rosberg finished in 5th place to give him 5th place in the championship. During the year, Rosberg earned the title \"King of the atmospherics\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Min\u00e4 vuonna Keijo Rosberg voitti viimeisen F1-sarjan osakilpailun?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1982"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

By the early 1950s, the strikes had become so common that they were sometimes considered a normal part of the arrival of winter. It was also jokingly said that a new icebreaker strike could be predicted simply by looking at the thermometer\u2014the \"strike limit\" would be reached when the temperature dropped low enough for the seas to freeze. When W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri announced a new strike in 1953, the Finnish Government decided to take action as the icebreaker strikes effectively stopped all foreign trade during the winter months, causing major losses for the Finnish industry. In Sweden, the state-owned icebreakers were part of the Swedish Navy and thus were not allowed to go on strike. On 9 February 1954, only four days before \"Voima\" was commissioned, it was decided to move the new icebreaker under the Finnish Navy, where it would replace the 77-year-old \"Von D\u00f6beln\" as the supply ship for the torpedo boats during the summer months. During the icebreaking season, the ship would still be crewed by the Navy, but used to escort merchant ships under the command of the Finnish Maritime Administration.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin j\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Voima laskettiin vesille?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1954"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Such ideas go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the \"geometria situs\" (Greek-Latin for \"geometry of place\") and \"analysis situs\" (Greek-Latin for \"picking apart of place\"). Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg Problem and Polyhedron Formula are arguably the field's first theorems. The term \"topology\" was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed. By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin Topologian k\u00e4site keksittiin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n17th century"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and in the case of lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: L\u00f6ytyyk\u00f6 alkalimetalleja luonnosta?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In describing society, Spencer alludes to the analogy of a human body. Just as the structural parts of the human body \u2014 the skeleton, muscles, and various internal organs \u2014 function independently to help the entire organism survive, social structures work together to preserve society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuka aloitti funktionalismin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nHerbert Spencer"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The term \"diabetes\" or \"to pass through\" was first used in 250 BC by the Greek Apollonius of Memphis. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in AD 400-500 with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with obesity. The term \"mellitus\" or \"from honey\" was added by Thomas Willis in the late 1600s to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus which is also associated with frequent urination. The first complete clinical description of diabetes was given by the Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. 1st century AD), who also noted the excessive amount of urine which passed through the kidneys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin diabetes havaittiin ensimm\u00e4isen kerran?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1500 BC"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The total mass is estimated to range between 1\/25 and 1\/10 the mass of the Earth. Conversely, models of the Solar System's formation predict a collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses. This missing >99% of the mass can hardly be dismissed, because it is required for the accretion of any KBOs larger than in diameter. If the Kuiper belt had always had its current low density, these large objects simply could not have formed by the collision and mergers of smaller planetesimals. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits makes the encounters quite \"violent\" resulting in destruction rather than accretion. It appears that either the current residents of the Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun, or some mechanism dispersed the original mass. Neptune's current influence is too weak to explain such a massive \"vacuuming\", though the Nice model proposes that it could have been the cause of mass removal in the past. Although the question remains open, the conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects, via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation. The extent of mass loss by collisional grinding is limited by the presence of loosely bound binaries in the cold disk, which are likely to be disrupted in collisions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mink\u00e4 kokoisia planeettoja Kuiperin vy\u00f6hykkeell\u00e4 on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1\/25 and 1\/10 the mass of the Earth"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed. The actual term \"atheism\" emerged first in the 16th century. With the spread of freethought, skeptical inquiry, and subsequent increase in criticism of religion, application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word \"atheist\" lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. The French Revolution, noted for its \"unprecedented atheism,\" witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason. The French Revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin ateismi on syntynyt?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nbefore the 5th century BCE"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" and Samuel Butler's \"Hudibras\". An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert's \"Robert the Devil\" and the A. C.

The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\u00bd\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.

The first European explorer to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642. The Dutch were also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline. Captain James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European explorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and various M\u0101ori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving M\u0101ori the same rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next century. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from M\u0101ori to P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) ownership, and most M\u0101ori subsequently became impoverished.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuka on perustanut Uuden-Seelannin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nPolynesians"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

This was finally opened by the Prince of Wales in 1875. He took considerable interest in the wild animals and wrote a book on the tiger and procured living specimens of the pygmy hogs for the Zoological Society of London. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1877, wrote much on subjects connected with the practice of medicine in India, and was especially known for his studies on the poisonous snakes of that country and on the physiological effects produced by their venom (\"Thanatophidia of India\", 1872). He researched snake venom along with Thomas Lauder Brunton in 1867 with assistance of Dr F. C. Webb. The book was printed by the Indian government and illustrated by artists from the Calcutta School of Art. In 1879, he spoke on \"The progress of epidemiology in India\" (published in 1880). In 1900 he published his autobiography, \"Recollections of my Life\". Fayrer knew Persian, several Indian languages and Italian. He also took an interest in anthropology and interacted with Thomas Henry Huxley on the topic. He proposed that an Ethnological Congress be held by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1866.

Bentley firm, nor from Rolls-Royce after the takeover of Bentley Motors in 1931. The \"Mark IV\" appellation seems to have been created by Ian Fleming, and erroneously perpetuated since. In contradistinction to the films, James Bond's official car in the Ian Fleming novels was a grey 1933 Bentley convertible. The car featured a 4.5-litre engine with the Amherst Villiers supercharger. In the novels, no gadgets were installed; this was Bond's personal vehicle that is mentioned in \"Casino Royale\" as being a hobby that Bond enjoys working on. Its only armament, in the novels, is a .45 Colt Army Special revolver Bond keeps in the glove compartment. The novel version of the Bentley Mark IV was destroyed during a chase sequence in \"Moonraker\". The Bentley is also the very first Bond vehicle seen in the film series, although it was shown very briefly during Bond's first scene in \"From Russia with Love\" and mentioned only in passing in \"Goldfinger\". In \"From Russia with Love\", the only gadget known to be included was a car phone, which in 1963 was very uncommon. The film version of \"Goldfinger\" strongly implies that the Bentley was issued to Bond by Q-Branch, since he asks Q about the vehicle, only to be told that it had \"had its day\". He is given the Aston Martin instead.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mit\u00e4 merkki\u00e4 on James Bondin erikoisauto?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nBentley"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape, yet only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition is similar to that of comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust, which could indicate the presence of liquid water under its south pole region, and may have a global ocean below its surface.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Montako kuuta saturnuksella on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n62"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Increasingly, attention is being paid to these short-term fluctuations by conducting experience sampling studies and diary studies. Christian, Garza, and Slaughter (2011) meta-analyzed over 90 engagement research studies.

Because the Finnhorse breed and its progenitors were the only horses in Finland for centuries, the history of horses in Finland parallels the history of the Finnhorse itself. The documented history of the distinct breed begins at the turn of the 13th century. Outside influences by many light and warmblood breeds were recorded beginning in the 16th century, making the breed larger and more usable. An official Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907, producing purebred animals in significant numbers for many years. Due to mechanisation of agriculture and the dismantling of Finnish horse cavalry in the later half of the 20th century, the Finnhorse population plummeted from a high of just over 400,000 animals in the 1950s to a low of 14,100 in 1987.

Completed around 30 AD, it is the third largest in Italy after Rome's Colosseum and the arena at Capua. It measures 139 metres long and 110 metres wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The \"ludi\" (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story fa\u00e7ade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains.The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre and open-aired opera during warm summer nights. There is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing.

Electromagnetic pickups, and sometimes piezoelectric pickups, convert the vibration of the steel strings into signals, which are fed to an amplifier through a patch cable or radio transmitter. The sound is frequently modified by other electronic devices (effects units) or the natural distortion of valves (vacuum tubes) or the pre-amp in the amplifier. There are two main types of magnetic pickups, single- and double-coil (or humbucker), each of which can be passive or active. The electric guitar is used extensively in jazz, blues, R & B, and rock and roll. The first successful magnetic pickup for a guitar was invented by George Beauchamp, and incorporated into the 1931 Ro-Pat-In (later Rickenbacker) \"Frying Pan\" lap steel; other manufacturers, notably Gibson, soon began to install pickups in archtop models. After World War II the completely solid-body electric was popularized by Gibson in collaboration with Les Paul, and independently by Leo Fender of Fender Music. The lower fretboard action (the height of the strings from the fingerboard), lighter (thinner) strings, and its electrical amplification lend the electric guitar to techniques less frequently used on acoustic guitars. These include tapping, extensive use of legato through pull-offs and hammer-ons (also known as slurs), pinch harmonics, volume swells, and use of a tremolo arm or effects pedals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kuka keksi kitaran?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nGeorge Beauchamp"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from \"Quercus robur\" and \"Quercus petraea\", was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mit\u00e4 tammesta yleisesti rakennetaan?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nfurniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Biebouw was flogged for his insolence and later banished to Jakarta. It is believed that \"Afrikaner\" in question initially indicated Cape Coloureds or other groups claiming mixed ancestry. Biebouw himself had numerous half-caste siblings and may have identified with Coloureds socially. However, this defiant secession from Dutch law and sovereignty was a leap towards defining another consciousness for white South Africa, suggesting for the first time a group identification with the Cape Colony rather than any ancestral homeland in Europe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Milloin afrikaanerit termi on kehitetty?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1707"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

While still an undergraduate he was appointed Andrews professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ireland, and lived at Dunsink Observatory. He made important contributions to optics, classical mechanics and algebra. Although Hamilton was not a physicist\u2013he regarded himself as a pure mathematician\u2013his work was of major importance to physics, particularly his reformulation of Newtonian mechanics, now called Hamiltonian mechanics. This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism, and to the development of quantum mechanics.

The king refused to call a meeting of the Estates General, but numerous local councils were summoned to meet in Compi\u00e8gne, where minor taxation concessions were made to partially fund the war effort.

Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen).

At that time he became an ardent opponent of a revolution and supported the monarchy. He began to write articles in his father's newspaper. He also held antisemitic views but opposed open violence such as the notorious pogroms which were common in Kiev at the time. Later, in 1913, he heavily criticised the government for the Beilis trial.

There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from op\u00e9ra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0430\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b \u041c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0301?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nParis Conservatoire"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899\u20131900. This view instead credits the 1902 work of Friedrich Oskar Giesel, who discovered a radioactive element named \"emanium\" that behaved similarly to lanthanum. The name actinium comes from the Greek \"aktis, aktinos\" (\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c2, \u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning beam or ray. This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0435\u043c \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d \u0410\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0438\u0434\u044b?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nVictor Goldschmidt"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The initial wave of high-altitude sites were mostly in the range, but astronomers soon sought even higher sites above . Among the largest, best developed, and most renowned of these high altitude sites is the Mauna Kea Observatory located near the summit of a volcano in Hawaii, which has grown to include over a dozen major telescopes during the four decades since it was founded. In the first decade of the 21st century, there has been a new wave of observatory construction at very high altitudes above , with such observatories constructed in India, Mexico, and most notably the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, now the site of several of the world's highest observatories. The scientific benefits of these sites outweigh the numerous logistical and physiological challenges which must be overcome during the construction and operation of observatories in remote mountain locations, even in desert, polar, and tropical island sites which magnify the challenges but confer additional observational advantages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nnear the summit of a volcano in Hawaii"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

During his studies at the Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium (1859\u20131863) along with his brother Sergei, he was arrested and kept for several days in the Peter and Paul Fortress for participating in student protests. The young students were saved by the Russian writer Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy who was a friend of Nicholas' father. In 1863, without finishing the gymnasium, Nicholas enrolled as a free listener at the St. Petersburg University but only spent two months there before being expelled in February 1864 and debarred from tertiary education in Imperial Russia for \"breaking the rules\". In March of the same year, with a forged passport, he moved abroad to complete his studies in German universities, which provided an opportunity to study and work with leading European scientists. He studied humanities at Heidelberg, medicine at Leipzig, and zoology at the University of Jena, where he came under the influence of the great German scholar Ernst Haeckel, who had a profound influence on his future.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0301\u0445\u043e-\u041c\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nHeidelberg, medicine at Leipzig, and zoology at the University of Jena"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Billington writes that the theory \"might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia\" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine \"Ogoniok\". Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that art and culture died during the Dark Ages and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of Byzantium could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology. Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as \"an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism\". Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, \"keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \"\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044e\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nmainstream scholars"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings when he was in the process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics.

The aid went to the United Kingdom, China, and later the Soviet Union, Free France, and other Allied nations. It included warships and warplanes, along with other weaponry. The policy was signed into law on March 11, 1941, and ended overnight without prior warning when the war against Japan ended. The aid was free for all countries, although goods in transit when the program ended were charged for. Some transport ships were returned to the US after the war, but practically all the items sent out were used up or worthless in peacetime.

His team included Norwegian pilot Leif Dietrichson, French pilot Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud, and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile's crew, whose new airship \"Italia\" had crashed while returning from the North Pole. Amundsen's French Latham 47 flying boat never returned. Later, a wing-float and bottom gasoline tank from the plane, which had been adapted as a replacement wing-float, were found near the Troms\u00f8 coast. It is believed that the plane crashed in fog in the Barents Sea, and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431 \u0420\u0443\u0301\u0430\u043b\u044c \u042d\u0301\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0442 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0410\u0301\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0441\u0435\u043d?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nArctic"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Anemia is a condition characterized by inadequate red blood cells (erythrocytes) or hemoglobin. When the body lacks sufficient amounts of iron, production of the protein hemoglobin is reduced. Hemoglobin binds to oxygen, enabling red blood cells to supply oxygenated blood throughout the body. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age) and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated it can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0427\u0435\u043c \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\niron-deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He was seriously wounded six times in his military career. Suvorov was always located in the most exposed position on the battlefield, for he wanted to share the same risks and discomforts as his soldiers. He never wore warm clothing during cold winters and always slept on a simple bed of straw. Forming a paternal relationship with his soldiers, he appreciated their courage and endurance and in return Suvorov enjoyed the loyalty, respect and affection of his troops. Suvorov\u2019s guiding principle was to detect the weakest point of an enemy and focus a devastating attack upon that area. He would send forth his units in small groups as they arrived on the battlefield in order to sustain momentum. Suvorov utilized aimed fire instead of repeated barrages from line infantry and applied light infantrymen as skirmishers and sharpshooters. He used a variety of army sizes and types of formations against different foes: squares against the Turks, lines against Poles, and columns against the French.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n63"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

His father, Matei Herescu, was a \"stolnik\" (a minor Wallachian nobleman) and a descendant of Wallachian boyars. He was also the brother-in-law of General Toma Cantacuzino (1665-1720), a Wallachian cavalry commander who served under Peter the Great. Herescu and other members of the Wallachian and Moldavian nobility had moved to the Russian Empire and entered the service of Peter following the unsuccessful Pruth River Campaign, a Russian offensive which sought to expel the Ottoman Empire from Moldavia and establish Russian garrisons in Moldavian fortress towns. Matei Herescu changed his name to Matvei Andreevich Kheraskov and received an estate near Pereiaslav in Left-bank Ukraine (along with 5,000 serfs, by some accounts). He attained the rank of major in the newly formed Chevalier Guard Regiment and eventually became commandant of the Pereiaslav fortress. He was married to Anna Danilovna Druckie-Sokolinskie, and died in 1734, leaving Anna to raise their three children, of which Mikhail was the youngest. In November 1735, Anna married Prince Nikita Yurievich Trubetskoy, a seasoned officer who was then serving as the \"general-krigs-komissar\" in the Ukrainian fortress town Izium, where Mikhail spent his earliest years. Because of his ancestry and the connections his stepfather afforded him, Kheraskov enjoyed the privileges of the highest ranks of the Russian nobility.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u0301\u043b \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1733"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

His first active service was in 1805, in the auxiliary army sent to the assistance of Austria against France, when he took part in the Battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805, where Austrian \u2013 Russian troops were defeated by the French under Napoleon. From 1807 to 1812, Ivan Paskevich was engaged in the campaigns against the Ottomans, and distinguished himself by many brilliant and daring exploits, being made a general officer in his thirtieth year. During the war with France in 1812\u20131814 he was present, in command of the 26th division of infantry, at all the most important engagements, and he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. On the outbreak of Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328) in 1826 he was appointed second in command, and, in the spring of the following year he replaced Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov as chief command. Under his leadership, Echmiadzin and the Nakhichevan Khanate were conquered from the Persians. After the Persians unsuccessfully tried to recapture Echmiadzin, the tsar granted Paskevich the title of \"Erivanskii\" (\"Count of Yerevan),\" a million rubles and a diamond-mounted sword for his services. The Russo-Turkish War, 1828\u20131829 immediately followed and he successfully led the eastern or Caucasus front. For this he was made a Field Marshal at the age of forty-seven. In 1830, he was engaged in the Caucasian War on the territory of present-day Dagestan. At the same time he appointed the high-ranking Muslim cleric Mir-Fatah-Agha from Iran as head of the recently established Caucasus Committee. Paskevich hoped that by the help of Mir-Fattah's high stature in the Muslim community, he could make a very valuable contribution to the Russian consolidation of power in the Caucasus. Together with Mir-Fatah's high esteem among Muslims and his devised plans for the Caucasus, they managed to keep the entire Caucasus stable from rebellious Muslim insurrections for many years to come. In June 1831, after the death of Field Marshal von Diebitsch, commander of Russian troops in Congress Poland, Paskevich was appointed his successor in crushing the Polish uprising. His armies, following the decisive success of Diebitsch at the Battle of Ostro\u0142\u0119ka in May, advanced slowly, but Paskevich redeemed his reputation at the Battle of Warsaw, giving a death blow to Polish hopes of restoring independence. He was created \"Prince of Warsaw\" and awarded the office of Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. With the kingdom's autonomy limited by the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland, the period under Namestnik Paskevich \u2013 known in Poland as the \"Paskevich Night\" \u2013 became infamous for political and economic repressions, as well as for Russification. On the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 he was appointed to command the Russian troops sent to aid Austria, and finally compelled the Hungarians' surrender at Vil\u00e1gos.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n19 May 1782"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Kicking off on 10 July, 3rd Shock Army had reached the Velikaya River by 12 July, captured the bridges despite the demolition charges laid on them, and gone on to outflank Idritsa. Idritsa was liberated that same day. Five days later the Army liberated Sebezh after a deep outflanking movement. Rezhitsa (now R\u0113zekne, Latvia) was taken on 26 July 1944, with the help of 10th Guards Army. 2nd Baltic Front was now facing central Latvia, and on 2 August 1944 the armies were on the march again, with 3rd Shock tasked to move south of Lake Luba\u0144 and on to south of Madon, but after the Soviet forces seized Krustpils, some heavy fighting followed with only limited success. 3rd Shock forced a passage over a tributary of the Dvina River, the Oger, on 19 August, but then had to fend off a strong German attack mounted by three divisions with air support. Slowly the Soviets moved toward Riga, but the emphasis was shifted south, and 2nd Baltic Front found itself playing a supporting role from early October as Bagramyan's First Baltic Front raced for the Baltic coastline itself to sever the remaining connection between the German forces in East Prussia and those in Latvia and Estonia. Riga fell on 13 October and the remaining German forces in the area were bottled up in the Courland area.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u041b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u041c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n2 August 1944"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Its roots reached back to 1798, when Scarlat C\u00e2mpineanu and other boyars founded a group of that name, inspired by the French First Republic. Reconstructing the party, Ioan C\u00e2mpineanu circulated a constitutional project that would have established a crowned republic, before being publicly shunned and forced into exile. L\u0103custeanu, at the time an officer in the Wallachian Militia, claims that: \"The aristocracy and the people were Russophiles, words such as 'patriotism' and 'public opinion' were only used by the prince and a couple of boyars.\" Nevertheless, as noted by scholar N. N. H\u00earjeu: \"With all their submission to the Muscovites, the boyars quickly understood that Russia only offered them apparent protection, in order to slowly strip them of their privileges. In fact, they hated both the Russians and the Turks.\" The chronicler Zilot Rom\u00e2nul recorded that the boyars were particularly worried by Russian tax farming, which they considered predatory. Among the more powerful boyars, some also opposed the prince, but for purely personal reasons\u2014they included Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea, who had seduced Ghica's divorcee mother, and was therefore detested by the monarch.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044b?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n1798"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts, which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply. Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power, and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West.

Ohkawa designs many of the characters early in the story's development; frequently appearing guest characters are designed from the beginning whereas minor characters are designed early on. As Ohkawa drafts the outline, the other three members formulate character designs by creating character profile sheets so as to avoid confusion. After drawing a sample story and sketch for their editor and receiving approval, Ohkawa assigns the roles to each group member and then chooses the visual styles depending on factors such as the complexity of the story, the chosen art style, and its relationship to the group's other works.

Marina had been married before and had three children, while Vladimir had two. They were married in 1969. For 10 years the two maintained a long-distance relationship as Marina compromised her career in France in order to spend more time in Moscow, and Vladimir's friends pulled strings in order for him to be allowed to travel abroad to stay with his wife. Marina eventually joined the Communist Party of France, which essentially gave her an unlimited-entry visa into the Soviet Union, and provided Vladimir with some immunity against prosecution by the government, which was becoming weary of his covertly anti-Soviet lyrics and his odds-defying popularity with the masses. The problems of his long-distance relationship with Vlady inspired several of Vysotsky's songs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043a \u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n10 years"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In order to achieve a career for her son, and aided by Kizlovsky, the family moved to Moscow, where Potemkin enrolled at a gymnasium school attached to the University of Moscow. The young Potemkin became adept at languages and interested in the Russian Orthodox Church. He enlisted in the army in 1750 at age eleven, in accordance with the custom of noble children. In 1755 a second inspection placed him in the \u00e9lite . Having graduated from the University school, Potemkin became one of the first students to enroll at the University itself. Talented in both Greek and theology, he won the University's Gold Medal in 1757 and became part of a twelve-student delegation sent to Saint Petersburg later that year. The trip seems to have affected Potemkin: afterwards he studied little and was soon expelled. Faced with isolation from his family, he rejoined the Guards, where he excelled. At this time his net worth amounted to 430 souls (serfs), equivalent to that of the poorer gentry.

After the graduation she took the examinations at the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute but failed due to flawed diction and enrolled in the Moscow University's Economy faculty. In 1959, after the graduation, she started teaching political economy at the University's Philosophy faculty. Before that, as a third year student, she joined the university Students' Theater, led by first Igor Lipsky, then Rolan Bykov. It was under the latter's guidance that in 1958 Demidova made her stage debut as Lida Petrusova in \"Such Kind of Love\" (Takaya lyubov), an adaptation of Pavel Kohout's play. Having joined the Shchukin School on the second attempt, Demidova started studying at the class of actress Anna Orochko, who experimented with her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and even suggested once that she should play Hamlet, something the actress would return to some forty years later. While still studying at the Shchukun Institute, Demidova performed in Vakhtangov Theatre's production of \"Death of Gods\" (Gibel bogov), in \"Princess Turandot\" and in \"The Cookie\" (\"\"). It was then that she was noticed by the French theatre specialist Jean Vilar who, after seeing the girl fencing in a gym, invited her to join the Theatre National Populaire, an offer that she had to decline. On the Shchukin stage she performed the leading role in Aleksander Afinogenov's \"Distant Things\" (Dalyokoye), played Mrs. Moon in \"The Scandalous Affair of Mr. Kettle and Mrs. Moon\" (after John Priestley's play of the same name) and Madame Frisette in \"Frisette\" by Eugene Marin Labiche. In 1957 Demidova debuted on screen in the director Zakhar Agranenko's \"Leningrad Symphony\". That was followed by \"Nine Years of One Year\" (director Mikhail Romm, 1961), \"What's a Relativity Theory?\" (Semyon Raitburg, 1963) and \"Komask\" (1965), the films she would later refer to as \"my reconnaissance raid.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0410\u0301\u043b\u043b\u044b \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044b \u0414\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0301\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nLeningrad Symphony"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

After Stalin's death in March 1953, Baghirov was accused of conducting repression, arrested in 1954, and tried and sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Soviet Union. In his final 17-minute speech before the court, he favored the sentence and refused to apply for any pardon. Baghirov was executed in 1956.

In the US, a Congressional Research Service report by Thomas Lum stated that the Kilgour\u2013Matas report relied largely on logical inference, without bringing forth new or independently obtained testimony; the credibility of much of the key evidence was said to be questionable. The initial 6 July 2006 report found that, \"the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained\" and concluded that \"there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners.\" U.N. special rapporteur Manfred Nowak said in March 2007 that the chain of evidence Kilgour and Matas were documenting showed a \"coherent picture that causes concern\", which the United Nations Committee Against Torture followed up in November 2008 with a request for \"a full explanation of the source of organ transplants\", to investigate the claims of organ harvesting, and to take measures to prosecute those committing abuses. Other investigators, such as Ethan Gutmann, followed the Kilgour\u2013Matas report; Gutmann estimating that between 450,000 and 1 million Falun Gong members were detained at any given time, and estimated that tens of thousands may have been targeted for organ harvesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0447\u0451\u0442 \u041a\u0438\u043b\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u2014 \u041c\u044d\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0430?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\n6 July 2006"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Unlike other Academies, the Prussian Academy was not directly funded out of the state treasury. Frederick granted it the monopoly on producing and selling calendars in Brandenburg, a suggestion from Leibniz. As Frederick was crowned \"King in Prussia\" in 1701, creating the Kingdom of Prussia, the Academy was renamed \"K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfische Soziet\u00e4t der Wissenschaften\" (\"Royal Prussian Society of Sciences\"). While other Academies focused on a few topics, the Prussian Academy was the first to teach both sciences and humanities. In 1710, the Academy statute was set, dividing the Academy into two sciences and two humanities classes. This was not changed until 1830, when the physics-mathematics and the philosophy-history classes replaced the four old classes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nPrince-elector Frederick III of Brandenburg"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

[it] drove me totally mad, I repeat it day and night and have learnt it by heart.\" \"Among his earlier verses there is the one truly timeless, that's been recognized by many (including Grigoryev and Rozanov) as something so much more important than just a verse - the tragic tale of a doomed love balancing on the verge of starvation and moral fall, - the one that starts with the words 'Whether I ride the dark street through the night...',\" wrote Mirsky. \"The Poems by N. Nekrasov\", published in October 1856, made their author famous. Divided into four parts and opening with the manifest-like \"The Poet and the Citizen\" (\u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442 \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d), it was organized into an elaborate tapestry, parts of it interweaved to form vast poetic narratives (like \"On the Street\" cycle). Part one was dealing with the real people's life, part two satirised 'the enemies of the people', part three revealed the 'friends of the people, real and false', and part four was a collection of lyric verses on love and friendship. The Part 3's centerpiece was \"Sasha\" (\u0421\u0430\u0448\u0430, 1855), an ode to the new generation of politically-minded Russians, which critics see as closely linked to Turgenev's \"Rudin\". In 1861 the second edition of \"The Poems\" came out (now in 2 volumes). In Nekrasov's lifetime this ever-growing collection has been re-issued several times. The academic version of the Complete N.A.

There will normally be three doors, one in the middle and one on either side. The central one is traditionally called the \"Beautiful Gate\" and is only used by the clergy. There are times when this gate is closed during the service and a curtain is drawn. The doors on either side are called the \"Deacons' Doors\" or \"Angel Doors\" as they often have depicted on them the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. These doors are used by deacons and servers to enter the sanctuary. Typically, to the right of the Beautiful Gate (as viewed from the nave) is the icon of Christ, then the icon of St John the Baptist; to the left the icon of the Theotokos, always shown holding Christ; and then the icon of the saint to whom the church is dedicated (i.e., the patron). There are often other icons on the iconostasis but these vary from church to church.

This has been referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL\/1 manuals of the 1960s. The use of unnamed magic numbers in code obscures the developers' intent in choosing that number, increases opportunities for subtle errors (e.g. is every digit correct in 3.14159265358979323846 and is this equal to 3.14159?) and makes it more difficult for the program to be adapted and extended in the future.

For seventeen years Bars I was crossed with different mares and sired eleven stallions that carried his distinguishing characteristics. The emergence of the breed was the result of a thorough and elaborate selection process. About 3,000 horses kept at the stud were involved.

A manuscript found at Bamberg states that Irish visitors to the court of Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad (died 844), king of Gwynedd in Wales were given a cryptogram which could only be solved by transposing the letters from Latin into Greek. Around the thirteenth century, the English monk Roger Bacon wrote a book in which he listed seven cipher methods, and stated that \"a man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it from the vulgar.\" In the 19th century Edgar Allan Poe helped to popularize cryptograms with many newspaper and magazine articles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nMiddle Ages"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

It was Vavilov who initially supported Lysenko and encouraged him on his work. Lysenko had a difficult time trying to grow various crops (such as peas and wheat), through the harsh winters. However, when he announced success, he was praised in the Soviet newspaper \"Pravda\" for his claims to have discovered a method to fertilize fields without using fertilizers or minerals, and to have shown that a winter crop of peas could be grown in Azerbaijan, \"turning the barren fields of the Transcaucasus green in winter, so that cattle will not perish from poor feeding, and the peasant Turk will live through the winter without trembling for tomorrow.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0301\u043c \u0414\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u044b\u0441\u0435\u0301\u043d\u043a\u043e?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nKiev Agricultural Institute"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

He narrowly failed in an attempt to be the first to cross under the North Pole in a submarine, but was able to prove that submarines were capable of operating beneath the polar ice cap, thereby paving the way for future successful missions.

These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels. Cosplay, a portmanteau for \"costume play\", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions. Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including \"otaku\", an unflattering Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga. Another word that has arisen describing fans in the United States is \"wapanese\" meaning White individuals who desire to be Japanese, or later known as \"weeaboo\" for individuals who demonstrate a strong interest in Japanese anime subculture, which is a term that originated from abusive content posted on the popular bulletin board website 4chan.org.

The name is abbreviated in an inscription from Nijmegen on the lower Rhine (\"[H]lud.\"); it appears as \"Hludana\" in the inscriptions from Xanten (lower Rhine) and Beetgum. The Beetgum inscription, dedicated by a group of fishermen, originally accompanied a carving of a seated goddess, of which only the bottom can now be seen. On etymological grounds, the name Hludana is closely related to Old Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd and \u03ba\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1 (\"kludoon(a)\" 'high waves, rough water') and Biblical Euroclydon, meaning a violent north-eastern wind.

In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, Del Rey submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled \"No Kung Fu\" to 5 Points Records, who subsequently offered her a recording contract for $10,000. Del Rey used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey, and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne, with whom she released a three-track EP titled \"Kill Kill\" in October 2008 as Lizzy Grant. She explained that \"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\" The album, however, was shelved, causing her to shift her focus: She began to work in community service. \"Homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation\u2014that's been my life for the past five years\", she told \"Vogue UK\" in 2012.

From 20 November 1943 it was led by SS-Brigadier General Fritz Freitag. Captain Wolf Dietrich Heike (temporarily seconded from the Wehrmacht) was the chief of staff from January 1944.

He made the first hovering flight on 29 December 1989 flying 48\u20133, and used the same aircraft to make the first complete transition from vertical to high-speed flight and vertical landing on 13 June 1990. From April 1991, various kinds of rolling take-off and run-on landings were performed on normal runways and also \"ski-jump\" ramps at the lift jet center at Saky. Throughout its testing, the aircraft demonstrated excellent combat maneuvers. Chief test pilot Sinitsyn went on to set twelve new world class records, but as the Yak-41 designation was classified, the records were submitted under the fictitious name \"Yak-141\". As a result, the previously unknown aircraft came to be known in the west as the \"Yak-141\". In 1992, Yakovlev repainted both flying aircraft in olive\/grey camouflage, with the Russian tricolor insignia, and painted a white \"141\" on both aircraft in place of their previous call signs, \"75\" and 77\". On 26 September 1991, Sinitsyn made the first vertical landing on the aircraft carrier \"Admiral Gorshkov\" (ex-\"Baku\") in 48-2. An hour later, Vladimir A. Yakimov landed 48-3 on the same deck. The pilots would go on to make eight flights from the ship until Yakimov made a hard landing on 5 October. The undercarriage ruptured a fuel tank, causing a serious fire. After almost 30 seconds, Yakimov ejected successfully, and was rescued from the sea. The aircraft was later repaired and placed on display. That same month the Soviet Navy announced that no further funds were available to continue the program. The factory at Smolensk had anticipated this and had not constructed the tooling for production.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u042f\u043a-141 \u0432 2018?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nno"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Odessa is a frequent subject in \"blatnaya pesnya\", and the city took on a mythical role as the cradle of Jewish gangster culture. \"Blatnaya pesnya\" are steeped in the mythology of Old Odessa, a city of excess, and a paradise for thieves, where a prominent Russian-Jewish culture was associated with both wealth and sin.  Although wrapped up in criminality and debauchery, Odessa was also \"a land of wit and irony\", in which Yiddish-inflected humour, brought over from the shtetls of Eastern Europe became the primary lens through which Old Odessa was depicted. Russian writer Isaac Babel popularized this image of \"a city of swashbuckling Jewish swindlers and sinners\", and the Jewish gangster came to epitomize Odessa in Soviet culture, in contradistinction to the victimized, tradition-oriented stereotype of the shtetl Jew. \"Odessa-mama\", a popular Yiddish and Russian collocation in literature and song, can be understood as a reference to the city's hospitality to criminals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u041e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043c\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nreference to the city's hospitality to criminals"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The present race had been converted to Islam two reigns before the accession of Bogra Khan whose Moslem name was Shaheb-ed Doulah Horun; and their appearance in Mohammadan history is principally in connection with the frequent wars which they waged with the Sammmani dynasty in Transoxiana and Khorasan who themselves had emerged from the same region.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0418\u043b\u0430\u0301\u043a?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nBogra Khan Ilak"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source. However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase explosively in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are few. In such situations, they can do major crop damage.

He considers the words that we use to indicate things and concepts could be any words \u2014 they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing. Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words.

On February 24, a group of men led by draper Jean le Gras, began sounding the great bells of the city's commune. Another group of men seized and closed the gates of the city, and a large mob quickly filled the streets. The mob was drawn largely from the poorest section of the city and was referred to as \"la merdaille\" by a local chronicler. The initial target of the mob was the wealthy, the town's councillors, the churches, and the tax farmers. Few people were killed, but there was widespread destruction. The mob looted every major building in the city. As the day progressed, the leaders of the mob directed the attack against any building thought to contain public records.

The initial threat proposed that \"a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center\", alluding to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, a 1989 mass shooting motivated by antifeminism. USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff, or the speaker. Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's open carry laws, leading to the cancellation. The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation. Wingfield of \"The New York Times\" referred to the threat as \"the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats. The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others. In mid-October Brianna Wu, another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio Giant Spacekat, saw her home address and other identifying information posted on 8chan as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence. Wu announced an reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online. As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u00ab\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439\u0442\u00bb?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\ns of April 2016"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The Confederate forces were commanded by General Robert E. Lee. The Confederacy and its opponent, the Union, had numerous differences. The Confederacy supported slavery, knowing that banning it would collapse pre-industrial cotton production. They were more religious and conservative.

It can be considered as an intermediate form of reacting compounds and products. The reaction can proceed from the transition state towards products or decompose into starting materials. Sometimes the transition state is called an activated complex, but according to the IUPAC definition, it is a different thing. A transition state is typically marked in the chemical literature by placing it in square brackets and marking it with a double cross \u2021. The transition state is unstable and very short-lived. It usually takes about 10 seconds. The transition state is not an actual molecule, because more bonds can leave the atom than the valence rules would allow and the bonds are not necessarily fully formed. So the transition state cannot be isolated like an intermediate product.

Rome split into Western Rome and Eastern Rome in 395. The western part of the Roman Empire fell in 476, when the last Western Roman emperor was deposed. Eastern Rome, or Byzantium, continued to operate until the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453. According to legend, the Roman Empire was founded by Romulus and Remus on April 21, 753 BC.

In reality, Rome was never actually founded, but developed into a city over a long period of time. According to legend, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus who founded Rome were descendants of Aeneas of Troy and Numitor, king of the Latins of Alba Longa. King Numitor had been dethroned by his cruel brother Amulius when Numitor's daughter Rhea Silvia was about to give birth.

The company was founded in Kyoto, Japan and produced and marketed Hanafuda playing cards. After the Japanese mafia Yakuza adopted the cards in their game caves, the popularity of the cards grew, and soon more people were hired in the company. Nintendo became the first successful Western playing card company in Japan.

According to the second main theory, the horse was brought by people who arrived from the south and southeast, who would have brought with them horses of Mongolian origin, more developed in the Ural and Volga regions. Both theories may be correct, because clearly distinct eastern and western types of horses survived in Finland for a long time.

Common are e.g. Vehicle-themed miniature models, as well as dolls, dollhouses and miniature rooms. Miniature models are used a lot to help architects' planning to illustrate the massing of the future building and its placement in its surroundings. In this field, the importance of miniature models has decreased, because the illustration of plans is also possible with the help of three-dimensional computer models. A miniature model can also be built from a building group or area of \u200b\u200bthe past. For example, the Museo della Civilt\u00e0 Romana in Rome has a miniature model of the Roman city of the imperial period, and Lappeenranta has a miniature model of Vyborg from 1939.

Personality disorders can cause serious problems and impaired functioning for people who suffer from them. According to the American Psychiatric Association, personality disorders are persistent patterns of mental experience and behavior that deviate significantly from the expectations of the person's own culture. These models are in many cases inflexible and unrelenting. The onset of the pattern can be traced at least to the beginning of adulthood. To be diagnosed as a personality disorder, the behavior pattern must cause significant distress or clear impairment in personal, social or work situations. The line between personality disorder and behavior considered normal is a slippery one.

The amino group is basic and the carboxyl group is acidic. Amino acids polymerize into polypeptides. When the length of the polypeptide chain exceeds 50, it is usually called a protein. There are 20 essential amino acids for humans, 11 of which the body can produce itself. The remaining nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. In cells, amino acids are produced under the control of enzymes. Amino acids most commonly occur at physiological pH (pH 7.4) as zwitterions, where the carboxyl group is negatively charged and the amino group is positively charged. If the amino group of an amino acid has bound a hydrogen atom donated by the carboxyl group of the same amino acid, the event is called internal salt formation. The COO group thus formed can then act as a base and the NH group as an acid.

The bond order number is compared to the single bond formed by one pair of electrons. The order of two pairs of electrons, i.e. the double bond, is 2 and the triple bond is 3. According to the molecular orbital theory, the bond order is the difference between the electrons located in the bonding orbitals and the orbitals located in the dissociating orbitals divided by two. Most often, the bond order number is a whole number, but it can also be a fractional number. This is typical for compounds whose structures have several resonance modes, for example the bond order of benzene is 1.5. The bond order number can be used as a qualitative measure of bond strength. The higher the bond order number, the stronger the bond is, and then the bond length is also shorter and the bond energy is higher than with a lower bond order number.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Ovatko molekyylien v\u00e4liset sidokset vahvempia kuin atomien v\u00e4liset sidokset?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nYes"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The shift is defined as the relative difference between the resonance frequency of the investigated material and the resonance frequency of the reference compound and is denoted by the symbol \"\u03b4\". The chemical shift depends on the chemical environment of the magnetic core, which can be used in molecular structure research. In compounds, magnetic atomic nuclei oscillate in an external magnetic field at a resonance frequency characteristic of each atomic nucleus. Also, the resonance frequencies of nuclei that are similar but in different chemical environments differ slightly from each other. These frequencies are compared to a reference standard and the difference is called the chemical shift. The electrons orbit the proton and create a magnetic field that weakens the effect of the external magnetic field on the proton. This phenomenon is called hedging.

The Lithuanian Soviet Republic ceased to exist on February 27, 1919, after it merged with the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic to become the Lithuanian-Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Although the leadership of the Lithuanian Soviet Republic presented the state as having been founded by Lithuanian workers, it was mainly a puppet state of Soviet Russia and the cause of the Lithuanian\u2013Soviet Russian War. Lithuanians generally did not support the Soviet sentiment and pushed for their own national Republic of Lithuania, whose independence was declared by the Council of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. The German Empire lost the First World War and signed the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne on November 11, 1918. The German army began to withdraw from the territories of the former Ober Ost.

The earliest signs of settlement in the area of \u200b\u200bthe city of Rome are from the Bronze Age, around the 14th century BC. Urbanization probably started in the 7th century BC. Over the centuries, Rome developed into a world power surrounding the Mediterranean. In 395, the empire split into two, the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, of which Western Rome fell already in 476, when its last emperor was deposed. Attempts to unify the Roman Empire under the leadership of Eastern Rome ended with the rise of Islam in the 6th century. Still, Eastern Rome, or Byzantium, existed, albeit with a considerably reduced area, until the Turkish occupation of Constantinople in 1453. In addition, the Empire of Trebizond survived until 1461 and the Principality of Theodoro until 1475.

In 1862, the merchant Holmberg left the company so that the Rosenlew brothers remained the owners of the company. In the 1860s, the Rosenlew company became even more of a sawmill industry company after it bought sawmills in Ikaalis and H\u00e4meenkyr\u00f6 and in 1877 the bankruptcy estate of Pori H\u00f6yrysaha. The economic boom that began around this time increased the profitability of the company's sawmill businesses. In 1872, Seiku's steam sawmill in Pori started operating as a new sawmill. At this time, the special roller track connecting N\u00e4sij\u00e4rvi and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi built by the Rosenlew company in Pispala, Tampere, made for transporting logs.

There is no evidence of an original wild horse population, and it does not seem likely that there ever was one, because significant numbers of domesticated horses were brought to Finland at an early stage. Most likely, the Finnish horse descends from the Northern European domestic horse. Based on the objects found in Finland, the keeping of horses can be seen in the form of drools and whiskers from the time of migration.

Miniature rooms can be made in, for example, a cardboard box, a paper bag, a jewelry box or a wooden showcase box with a glass front wall. Miniature rooms have also been made inside old books, a watering can, a monitor, a speaker and a sewing machine box. Small rooms can be decorated in many different styles. Dollhouses typically always have certain rooms (kitchen, bedroom, living room, bathroom, children's room) that are decorated in the same style and era. The builder of miniature rooms, on the other hand, can focus on, for example, bathrooms through the centuries or kitchens from different countries. Miniature rooms are also built as gifts.

Personality partly has a genetic basis, but it also changes and develops throughout life through the interaction of the individual and his environment, especially during childhood. There is no single established definition of personality in the field of psychology, and the concept is used in different ways. What most definitions of personality have in common is that personality refers to both a person's external activity, visible to other people, and the person's internal, private world of experience. According to Gordon Allport's (1937) well-known definition, personality is a dynamic set of psychophysical structures within a person that affects how a person adapts to his environment.

Omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is an essential fatty acid for humans, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). A person must get alpha-linolenic acid and DHA fatty acid from food. The human body is able to produce some EPA fatty acid from alpha-linolenic acid, but it is not necessarily produced in the optimum amount for health, which is why it is recommended to add fatty fish or fish oil to the diet. In 2008, the Harvard University Information Center suggested that the human body could not produce eicosapentaenoic acid EPA or docosahexaenoic acid DHA, and therefore recommended regular consumption of fatty fish or, alternatively, consumption of EPA and DHA extracted from algae.

The Finnish horse is descended from horses brought to Finland with people, with which many breeds and types of horses have been mixed and purposefully crossed over the years. Starting in the 16th century, a bigger and stronger horse started to be bred from the original small-sized Finnish country breeds and mixed crossbreeding effects. In the 19th century, four different types of the Finnish horse were known, which later merged into each other. Cross-breeding continued to wane until the end of the 19th century, when, with the development of Finnish nationalism, the Finnish horse type, perceived as a symbol of Finland, was also wanted to be refined into a breed and foreign traits weeded out. In 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association \"Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos\", now the national central organization of the field, Suomen Hippos, was founded for this task. As a result of the breeding work, a Finnish horse was born, with a pedigree<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Mist\u00e4 hevoset ovat tulleet Suomeen?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nIn the 13th century"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

The disease is considered to start most often in early adulthood and is estimated to occur more often in males than females. Estimates of the prevalence of the disease in the population vary between 0.5 and 2.5 percent. The assessment of prevalence has been complicated by the problem of differential diagnosis with paranoid schizophrenia. People with a suspicious personality often doubt their partner's loyalty. Suspicious personality sufferers are often hostile, violent and involved in lawsuits. Suspicious personality sufferers have a combative and stubborn awareness of their own rights. In the treatment of suspicious personality, supportive psychotherapy based on a confidential treatment relationship (= supportive psychotherapy) is considered to be the most important.

The designation also means the state where such a system is in force. The administration of a democratic republic is based on the power of parliamentarians. The rule of law is one of the basic conditions of a republic. A republic is often called the opposite of a monarchy. The definition is usable, but not valid in some borderline cases, and not when the difference between republic and monarchy is defined differently than in modern society. The concept of oligarchy does not fit either option either. The concept of a republic as unequivocally the opposite of a monarchy is too general and does not take into account, for example, the diversity of different monarchies (see form of government).

Norns live in Asg\u00e5rd, at the foot of the world tree Yggdrasil and by the well of Urd, where they spin the thread of destiny for each person born. According to one legend, Urd spins the threads, Verdandi twists them together, and Skuld cuts the thread. However, nothing lasts forever, and even Yggdrasil is bound to wither.

Japan's agriculture is limited by mountainous and rugged terrain, and only a small portion of its soil is suitable for agriculture. Japan's most important crop is rice. In addition to that, sugar beets, vegetables and fruits are also cultivated. The most important livestock products are pork, poultry, milk and eggs. In addition to these, fishing is also practiced considerably in Japan, and the country's annual fish catch is one of the largest in the world. However, overfishing and pollution have led to the depletion of Japan's nearby waters. Agriculture accounts for 1.4% of Japan's GDP. Japan's own agricultural production is not able to cover the country's food consumption, so even half of Japanese people's food supplies are imported from abroad.

Pigs usually live in pens, where there are usually dozens of pigs. Pig pens and pig pens have different requirements than, for example, living areas for sheep or cows: Meat pigs usually have a pen with a concrete and grate base, from which the manure flows through the grate into the slurry tank. The piggery is completely dependent on mechanical ventilation: if the electricity goes out, the pigs die from lack of oxygen as the ammonia secreted from their manure fills the air space. Newborn pigs, or piglets, usually live in a sow piggery. At the age of just over two months, the piglets are sold to fattening pigs. However, the best individuals are left in the sow fish to continue the breed. With the industrialization of agricultural production, the so-called piglets. In Finland, the average size of a piggery is 100\u2013200 pigs, but piggeries of several hundred pigs are becoming more common.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Kasvatetaanko Suomessa sikoja?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>"},{"label":"false","text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>"},{"label":"true","text":"\n\nyes"},{"label":"false","text":"<|eot_id|>"}]}

In humans, the fertile sex is women and the fertile sex is men. In addition to gametes, an individual's gender is defined in biology on the basis of sex chromosomes, the genes connected to them that are necessary for determining sex, sex hormones, i.e. endocrinology, gonads, and the morphology of the external genitalia. Family reproduction involves combining and mixing genetic traits. When the gametes are similar in shape and function, we speak of isogamy and otherwise of anisogamy. The latter is more common in the organism.

Martin Luther argued that Jesus Christ gave the power of the keys to all of his followers, and not to any particular faction of those close to him: At the same time, Luther warned that no one becomes a pastor of his own accord, but only by election by the community.

These planets, which share a number of similar physical characteristics, are also called outer planets. Unlike the stone planets of the terrestrial group, they are all gas planets, have significantly larger sizes and masses (as a result of which the pressure in their interiors is much higher), lower average density (close to the average Solar, 1.4 g \/ cm\u00b3), powerful atmospheres, rapid rotation, as well as rings (while the terrestrial planets do not have such) and a large number of satellites.

Left in 1742 and died on the way. There are only three signed works by Nikitin, along with those attributed to him, only about ten. Early works still contain traces of the parsuna, which was the only portrait style in Russia in the 17th century. Nikitin is one of the first (often referred to as the first) Russian artists who moved away from the traditional icon-painting style of Russian painting and began to paint with perspective, as they did in Europe at that time. Thus, he is the founder of the tradition of Russian painting, which continues to this day. All works where Nikitin's authorship is undoubtedly portraits.
