The game series is perhaps the best-known example of the so-called of Japanese-style console role-playing games. It draws its ideas from other console RPGs of the late 1980s, most notably Enix's popular \"Dragon Quest\" series. The games have long been popular in Japan; In the US they finally broke through with \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Final Fantasy VI\" (these games were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as \"Final Fantasy II\" and \"Final Fantasy III\"), and the international breakthrough came with \"Final Fantasy With VII\" (which was also the first game in the series released in Europe). Besides the actual \"Final Fantasy\" games, other games and products have also been published under the same name.

German losses totaled 360 dead. The intervention was formally requested by the Finnish government, but it was also part of Germany's own war plans. The intervention was made possible by the peace of Brest-Litovsk signed with Soviet Russia at the beginning of March, which ended hostilities on the Eastern Front of the First World War. Germany's interest was based on its own interests in Finland's natural resources and foreign trade, among other things, because the country itself was embargoed by neighboring powers. The Finnish government, on the other hand, wanted to end the civil war as quickly as possible, because it did not trust the ability of the army assembled by General C. G. E. Mannerheim to quickly defeat the Red Guards. The intervention further deepened the plight of the Reds, and the war ended after only a month. After this, the German army always remained in Finland<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>","label":"false"},{"text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>","label":"false"},{"text":"\n\n13000","label":"true"},{"text":"<|eot_id|>","label":"false"}]}

The Republican Party candidate, incumbent Texas Governor George W. Bush, who is the son of former President George H. W. Bush, defeated the Democratic candidate, incumbent Vice President Al Gore. The outcome of the election hinged on Florida, where a narrow margin of victory caused a mandatory recount. More recounts were initiated by legislation in certain counties, and the dispute eventually reached the US Supreme Court. The court's decision (5-4) on December 12 stopped the recounts, with Florida's votes being counted for Bush, who thus won the election. This was the fourth time in US history that the winning candidate did not receive a majority of the popular vote. The vote difference in Florida was 537 votes between the candidates.

The Russian government, the Council of People's Commissars, issued an order to establish the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on January 28 (new chapter) 1918. The army was formed from the Red Guards of the Soldiers' Soviets led by the Bolsheviks. The Red Army was organized by Lev Trotsky, who in August became the People's Commissar or Minister of War and Maritime Affairs (until 1925).

There were an extraordinary number of forest fires: more than 23,000 separate fires. Forests burned especially in Siberia, but there were also dozens of separate fires near the Finnish border. The dry summer of that year contributed to the fires. The smoke from the fires that spread to Finland became the focus of attention, especially after the beginning of August. The smoke also spread to Sweden. In large areas in southern Finland, the air quality clearly deteriorated in some places, and smoke could easily be seen and smelled. The smoke particularly bothered some asthma patients. Russia has the airplanes needed to extinguish fires, but they were extinguishing much larger forest fires in Siberia. Russia was criticized for not trying to extinguish the fires effectively enough.

The grains of the rice variant \"glutinous rice\" (v. glutinosa) turn into a sticky mass when cooked. Glutinous rice contains less starch, but more sugar and dextrin than regular rice, and it is used to make soft drinks. Rice is an exceptionally useful food for humans due to its protein composition. The amino acid arginine contained in the grain is in an ideal form for the human body. Environmentalists often recommend using plants other than rice. In Finland, rice replaced barley in cooking in the 1950s. Rice grows wild in Southeast Asia. The earliest records of rice cultivation are from the Khorat highlands in the northeast of present-day Thailand around 3,000 BC. Rice cultivation also influenced the development of the region's social and political system. Rice has already been brought to Finland in the 17th century. Back then, only rich nobles could afford it.

As the Roman Empire crumbled in Europe, the era of national migrations began. However, the traditional knowledge of the early times was preserved in the monasteries. From the 7th century, Islamic nations conquered the eastern and southern parts of Europe. Charlemagne, who was crowned Roman emperor in 800, ruled large areas of Western and Central Europe. He has been called \"the father of Europe\". After the fall of his empire, the Holy Teutonic Roman Empire was established.

It wasn't until after Kubrick's death that the film appeared in the country as VHS and DVD releases. Ludwig van Beethoven's music (especially the ninth symphony) plays an important role in the film's plot. Other classical music, such as Rossini and Elgar, is heard in the film.

Industrial activity in the production facilities began in 1853, when the Oy W Rosenlew Ab family business started its operations. The production of the company's main product, the combine harvester, began at the Pori factory in 1957. The design and manufacture of industrial washing machines began in 1993 to support seasonal combine harvester sales. Washing machines soon formed their own product group. The industrial washing machine business was sold in 2011 to the Finnish Aqua Clean Oy. In 1996, the company introduced the first Sampo-Rosenlew forest harvester model SR1046. The group's headquarters is in Pori, where its largest production unit is located. Combine harvesters and forest harvesters are manufactured in Pori, industrial washing machines were sold in 2012.

Its center was a castle, and the chief was either a king or a commanding officer who enjoyed the trust of the nobility. The area administered by Linn\u00e4l\u00e4\u00e4n generally corresponded to one province of the provincial administration. Linnala\u00e4ni was divided into municipalities and administrators. The church had its own administrative system. The feudal system that generally prevailed in Western Europe in the Middle Ages influenced the development of castle counties, but in the North the feudal system never established its position as it was in other parts of Europe. The birth of the castle fiefdoms in Finland is related to the establishment of Swedish power, and its timing is based on scattered years. The castle counties were replaced by fiefdoms created in the form of government of 1634 and the subsequent rule of the lord of the land, which were the basis for the subsequent division of counties.

It usually corresponds to a full general of the army. Like general, the word admiral can refer not only to the rank of full admiral, but also to lower admiral ranks. The word admiral comes from the Arabic term \u0639\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \"'am\u012br-al-ba\u1e25r\" (commander of the seas). The Crusaders learned the term, and it began to be used in Europe as early as the 11th century. There are four admiral ranks in the Finnish Navy, from the highest to the lowest \"admiral\", vice admiral, rear admiral and flag admiral. In the Finnish Defense Forces, there can be only one officer of the rank of full admiral or general in active service at a time, who acts as the commander of the defense forces.

Bras\u00edlia was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1987. The original layout of Bras\u00edlia was designed in such a way that traffic would not be congested without traffic lights. Cross-level interchanges and long curved ramps were built on the thoroughfares. The city grew bigger than planned, but traffic still runs better than in other big cities in Brazil.

Golden rice has been developed by genetically manipulating Asian rice (\"Oryza sativa\"). It was developed by Ingo Potrykus together with researcher Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The work began in 1992, and its results, considered a breakthrough in biotechnology, were published in 2000. The rice variety aims to combat the problems caused by the one-sided diet of people in developing countries. It is hoped that the new rice variety will save millions of lives and prevent half a million people from going blind each year. The rice variety has not been introduced in developing countries. In developing countries, there is a fear that, from the point of view of Westerners, the food produced in developing countries will be \"contaminated\" due to genetic manipulation, and the food produced there will not be suitable for Western countries. In addition, many organizations oppose the introduction of golden rice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>","label":"false"},{"text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>","label":"false"},{"text":"\n\nKolmen kuningaskunnan aikakaudella","label":"true"},{"text":"<|eot_id|>","label":"false"}]}

In addition, a detachment of volunteer Swedish soldiers, called the Swedish Brigade, led by Captain Hjalmar Frisell, was sent to white Finland. However, its actual total strength of 250\u2013550 men (strength data varies) corresponded mostly to a reinforced battalion. In addition to volunteer soldiers, Sweden promoted its foreign policy interests in Finland by sending a naval and military detachment to \u00c5land on February 15, 1918. The motive for the act was the \u00c5land people's \"requests for help\" to Sweden. In fact, the reason was geopolitical power factors.

Transliteration can occur between two systems based on phonetic writing (for example, Latin and Cyrillic), but one or both writing systems can be based on syllabic or word writing. Conversion to the Latin alphabet in particular is called \"Latinization\" and the system used in it, as well as the end result, \"Latinization\" (following foreign language models, one can also speak of \"Latinization\" or \"Romanization\").

The four giant planets, also called gas giants, together contain 99% of the mass of matter that orbits the sun. Jupiter and Saturn are predominantly made up of hydrogen and helium; Uranus and Neptune have more ice in their composition. Because of this, some astronomers classify them in their own category - \"ice giants\". All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's ring system is easily visible from Earth. Jupiter has a mass of 318 times that of the earth, and 2.5 times more massive than all other planets,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>","label":"false"},{"text":"assistant<\\|end_header_id\\|>","label":"false"},{"text":"\n\n\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435","label":"true"},{"text":"<|eot_id|>","label":"false"}]}

Faith as the primary merit. Semi-Pelagianism was recognized as correct at the Council of Arles in 475, but at the Council of Orange in 529, simultaneously with the approval of the teachings of Augustine, Semi-Pelagianism was defined as a material heresy, that is, an unintentional error in important matters of faith. The approval of Pope Boniface II increased the authority of the decrees of the Council of Orange, which the Council of Trent also reckoned with. The points put forward there are consistent with the teachings of Augustine, but there is no clear doctrine of predestination (predestination to sin is rejected and anathematized), and not enough space is given to the internal process accomplished by grace, which Augustine emphasized most of all.

It quickly turns out that the real Garin managed to escape from the foreign killers - his friend, disguised as a real engineer, died. Garin himself fled abroad.
