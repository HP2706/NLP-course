Bush, who is the son of former President George H. W. Bush, defeated the Democratic candidate, incumbent Vice President Al Gore.

The court's decision (5-4) on December 12 stopped the recounts, with Florida's votes being counted for Bush, who thus won the election.

The work began in 1992, and its results, considered a breakthrough in biotechnology, were published in 2000. The rice variety aims to combat the problems caused by the one-sided diet of people in developing countries. It is hoped that the new rice variety will save millions of lives and prevent half a million people from going blind each year. The rice variety has not been introduced in developing countries. In developing countries, there is a fear that, from the point of view of Westerners, the food produced in developing countries will be \"contaminated\" due to genetic manipulation, and the food produced there will not be suitable for Western countries.
